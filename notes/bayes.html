<p>For whatever reason, people who rate books—whether memoirs, plotty entertainments, genre mash-ups, inspirational tear-jerkers, or esoteric award-winners—really love to rate books four stars. As of April 2013, 38.9% of all 2.8 million Goodreads ratings recorded for the 80 books on my list were four star ratings. For 60 of the titles, the four star was the most frequently chosen rating. For the other 20, it was the second most frequently chosen rating.</p>

<p>My reply: Indeed, even if evidence from the data at hand is not convincing, that doesn’t mean we have to do nothing. I strongly oppose using a statistical significance threshold to make decisions. In general I have three recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use prior information. For example, in that silly beauty-and-sex-ratio study, we have lots of prior information that any differences would have to be tiny. We know ahead of time that our prior information is much stronger than the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it comes to decision making, much depends on costs and benefits. We have a chapter on decision analysis in Bayesian Data Analysis that illustrates with three examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As much as possible, use quantitative methods to combine different sources of information:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>– Define the parameter or parameters you want to estimate.</p>
<p>– Frame your different sources of information as different estimates of this parameter, ideally with statistically independent errors.</p>
<p>– Get some assessment of the bias and variance of each of your separate estimates.</p>
<p>– Then adjust for bias and get a variance-weighted estimate. --- <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/09/21/have-weak-data-but-need-to-make-a-decision-what-to-do/">Have weak data.
