<p>The device is often included as a free perk for Hertz’s Gold members, meaning Hertz is taking the risk of creeping out its most loyal customers with the camera eye in the car. When asked whether customers were informed there would be a camera in the car, or told under what circumstance it would be activated, Imperatrice again emphasized that the cameras had never been used. The camera on our NeverLost 6 devices has never been active (hence, it is never on) and we have no current plans to activate the camera in the future, she said by email. --- <a href="http://fusion.net/story/61741/hertz-cameras-in-rental-cars/">Hertz puts cameras in its rental cars, says it has no plans to use them -- Fusion</a></p>
<p>The twin publication of the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture and Mohamedou Slahi’s Guantánamo Diary has unleashed a disorienting irony: in the Age of Total Information Awareness, in the era of the NSA dragnet, meaning itself is redacted. The more information our government collects, the less we seem to know. Even worse: the gap between what those in power know and what we know now overwhelms the dragnets of our imaginations. This explains why our philosophers, like Slavoj Žižek, revert to the platitudes of Donald Rumsfeld to explain the issues of the day: under the tyranny of unknown knowns, even our public intellectuals bow down to the knowledge, the intelligence, of the governing elite. --- <a href="http://flavorwire.com/505122/the-war-novel-in-the-age-of-total-information-awareness">The War Novel in the Age of Total Information Awareness – Flavorwire</a></p>

<p>Why spy? That’s the several-million pound question, in the wake of the Snowden revelations. Why would the US continue to wiretap its entire population, given that the only terrorism they caught with it was a single attempt to send a small amount of money to Al Shabab?</p>
<p>One obvious answer is: because they can. Spying is cheap, and cheaper every day.  --- <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/10/nsa-gchq-technology-create-social-mobility-spy-on-citizens">Technology should be used to create social mobility – not to spy on citizens | Technology | The Guardian</a></p>
