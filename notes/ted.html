<article><p>CHANCES are you will not attend TED this year. Tickets to the gathering that begins Monday in Vancouver are sold out, this despite or rather because of the fact that gaining entry to the ideas conference entails more than pulling out your credit card. There’s a velvet rope of an application process, and questions to answer: How would a friend describe your accomplishments? What are you passionate about? Two references have to vouch for you. --- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/the-church-of-ted.html">The Church of TED - NYTimes.com</a></p>
