<article><p>If I could attempt to transcribe it, it sounds kind of like, y’know … this.</p>
<p>That is, in addition to looser language, the speaker generously employs pauses and, particularly at the end of sentences, emphatic inflection. (This is a separate issue from upspeak, the tendency to conclude statements with question marks?) A result is the suggestion of spontaneous speech and unadulterated emotion. The irony is that such presentations are highly rehearsed, with each caesura calculated and every syllable stressed in advance.</p>
<p>In literary circles, the practice of poets reciting verse in singsong registers and unnatural cadences is known, derogatorily, as poet voice. I propose calling this phenomenon NPR voice (which is distinct from the supple baritones we normally associate with radio voices). --- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/fashion/npr-voice-has-taken-over-the-airwaves.html?_r=0">‘NPR Voice’ Has Taken Over the Airwaves - The New York Times</a></p></article>
