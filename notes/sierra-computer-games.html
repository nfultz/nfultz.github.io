<article><p>The company was going great and literally had a 28 percent market share. In other words, 28 cents out of every dollar spent on entertainment software for home computers in the US went to Sierra. They had a tremendous product line in all aspects of entertainment home software, all kinds. That was the company that Ken and Roberta [Williams] literally started on their kitchen table and built to a billion-dollar market capitalization company.</p>
<p>One of Ken's board members on a Monday morning called and said, &quot;I'm gonna stage a hostile takeover of your company and I'm gonna offer 50 percent more than the going price of the stock. If you fight me, every stockholder in the country will file a lawsuit against you for not accepting this wonderful offer from me.&quot; It was like, &quot;Okay, I guess you're in charge now.&quot;</p>
<p>Turned out that one thing led to another, the company went away, Ken and Roberta went away, the company changed hands, and it turned out that the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C. investigated and found out that the entire business was a kind of a house of cards. They didn't have the money that they said they had, they didn't have the means to do this stuff, and they ended up fining them the largest fine in the history of the United States government. Over a billion dollars, as I recall. This was pre-Enron, of course. [Laughs.] Enron broke the record, I suppose.</p>
<p>But, yeah. Sierra ended up being the victim of this takeover, and then, the government went after these guys and said, &quot;You're guilty of fraud.&quot; And after a number of trials, the guy who staged the whole thing, plus at least two of his henchmen ended up going to federal penitentiary back in New England and hopefully until this day are making big rocks into little ones. [Laughs.] I hope. But I doubt it. It's probably more of a country club.  --- <a href="http://www.nodontdie.com/al-lowe/">Al Lowe</a></p>
