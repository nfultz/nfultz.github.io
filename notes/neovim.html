    <h1> Neovim Notes </h1>

    <h2> Using old vim configs </h2>

    Neovim has moved the location of default config under $XDG_CONFIG,
    but there is a snippet to load them in:

    <pre>

    set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
    let &packpath = &runtimepath
    source ~/.vim/vimrc

    </pre>


    <h2>cmdheight = 0</h2>

    Vim doesn't allow one to hide the command line.

    I had posted a half working patch to github in 2014:
    <a href=https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1004>[1]</a>.

    It was finally fully implemented by a guy from japan in 2022:
    <a href=https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16251>[2]</a>

    <h2>Plugin Ecosystem</h2>

    Neovim can use vim plugins, but it also supports plugins written in lua.

    Apparently the most popular plugin manager is 
    <a href=https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim>packer.nvim</a>

    To install it, clone the repository into your home directory:

    <pre>
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
     ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
    </pre>

    You can then activate it by adding the below to your init.vim:

    <pre>
    lua require('plugins')
    </pre>


    <h2>Language Server Protocol</h2>

    <p>LSP is an api that allows language-specific IDE features such
    as jumping to defintions, which largely replaces the tags features
    in regular vim.

    <p> While neovim has a built in client, it does not come with the LSP
    server nor with any integration with the user interface. More plugins 
    are required.

    <p> The below plugins can be installed via packer by adding them to 
    `plugins.lua`:

    <pre>
      use {
        "williamboman/mason.nvim",
        "williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim",
        "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
      }
    </pre>

    <p> `mason.vim` is a package manger neovim
    for installing external editor tools such as 
    LSP servers, debuggers, linters, formatters, and so on
    that are not themselves vim plugins.

    <p> `nvim-lspconfig` is the official if not officially
    supported set of LSP configuration files for neovim.

    <p> `mason-lspconfig.nvim` is an adaptor package
    to allow mason to install and configure LSP.

    <p> After incorporating the above use lines into your config,
    you can trigger packer using `:PackerSync` in command mode.

    <p> From there, you can enable the mason plugins by adding them
    to the plugins.lua script:

    <pre>
      require("mason").setup()
      require("mason-lspconfig").setup()
    </pre>

    <p>Assumming that worked, you can use `:LspInstall` and related commands
    to download and install a mason packaged version of a LSP server
    to your local configuration

    <p>However, we are not done yet. While you can integrate the LSP
    into the built-in OmniFunc completion, an autocompletion plugin is recommended.
    <a href=https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/wiki/Autocompletion>[3]</a>

    <p> `nvim-cmp` is the recommended autocomplete plugin. Add the below to
    install it and it's dependencies:

    <pre>
      use { -- Autocompletion
        'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
        requires = { 'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp', 'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip', 'saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip' }
      }
    </pre>

    Don't forget to re-sync packer.

    <p> Next, you have to configure the LSP plugin with the autocompletion capabilities:

    <pre>
      local capabilities = require("cmp_nvim_lsp").default_capabilities()

      require('lspconfig')['pyright'].setup{
          capabilities = capabilities
      }
    </pre>

    <p> Each LSP server you install and use will need to be configured in a similar manner.

    <p> Finally, I recommend you add the key mappings as mentioned on the Autocompletion wiki page.

    <h2> Copilot </h2>

    After all that to get LSP autocompletion, it turns out the Copilot / GPT3 
    is implemented completely differently anyways. See 
    <a href=https://github.com/github/copilot.vim>copilot.vim</a>.

    <h2> Mouse is always on </h2>

    Neovim always compiles with mouse support. This is generally fine, but do note
    that clicking in the window (eg to give it focus) will move the mouse cursor,
    and Right Click is now a text-based context menu instead of the default X11 paste.
