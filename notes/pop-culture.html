<article><p>A Naked Singularity tells the story of Casi, a child of Colombian immigrants who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan as a public defender--one who, tellingly has never lost a trial.

<p>This is especially true given the demise of the so-called Privilege Sign, which was a retail placard given free to store owners by a supplier of a product sold within.</p>
<p>The most common privilege signs had Coke or Pepsi logos on them. Those signs have been vanishing since the 1960s, according to the Ephemeral New York website, which tracks remaining examples of the retail artifact. Without such signage, Swormstedt says, a flashy placard is the most valuable tool a shopkeeper can utilize. --- <a href="https://medium.com/matter/thing-piece-the-ugliest-sign-in-america-5f53652ba7b">Thing Piece: The Ugliest Sign in America — Matter — Medium</a></p>
