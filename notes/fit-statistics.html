<article><p>In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F1 score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of positive results that should have been returned. The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.</p>
<p>The traditional F-measure or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:</p>
<pre><code>F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{\mathrm{precision}   \mathrm{recall}}. --- [F1 score - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score)
