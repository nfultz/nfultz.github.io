<article><p>The technological singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing civilization in an event called the singularity.</p>
<p>The first use of the term &quot;singularity&quot; in this context was by mathematician John von Neumann. In 1958, regarding a summary of a conversation with von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam described &quot;ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue&quot;. The term was popularized by science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]], who argues that artificial intelligence, human biological enhancement, or brain–computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity. Futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] cited von Neumann's use of the term in a foreword to von Neumann's classic The Computer and the Brain. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">wikipedia</a></p>

<p>A single neuron in the brain is an incredibly complex machine that even today we don’t understand. A single neuron in a neural network is an incredibly simple mathematical function that captures a minuscule fraction of the complexity of a biological neuron. So to say neural networks mimic the brain, that is true at the level of loose inspiration, but really artificial neural networks are nothing like what the biological brain does --- <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/google-brains-co-inventor-tells-why-hes-building-chinese-neural-networks-662d03a8b548">Google Brain’s Co-Inventor Tells Why He’s Building Chinese Neural Networks — Backchannel — Medium</a></p>
