Thanks to Kalin, St. Kitts has become the world’s most popular place to buy a passport, offering citizenship for $250,000 with no requirement that applicants ever set foot on the island’s sun-kissed shores. Buyers get visa-free travel to 132 countries, limited disclosure of financial information, and no taxes on income or capital gains. The program became so successful that St. Kitts emerged from the global financial crisis far ahead of its neighbors in the Caribbean. It’s been a complete transformation, says Judith Gold, head of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.

Alternatively, you can work your way in from outside by being suitably deferential and supportive to the inner circle, meeting all of its expectations and conforming to its opinions and decisions, until the senior members of the elite start treating you as a junior member and the junior members have to deal with you as an equal. You can watch that at work, as already mentioned, in your local church—and you can also watch it at work in the innermost circles of power and privilege in American life.

But high-end real estate on Long Island is quickly gaining steam. Of the 136 deals that closed between Jan. 1, 2013 and Jan. 30, 2015 for $3 million or higher, 37 of them, or 27 percent, were to Chinese buyers, according to a recent search on Nassau County’s multiple listing service.
