<article><p>Because of this interaction, high property taxes reduce the value of property, again due to the hot potato effect. Low property taxes raise the value of property and trigger speculation. In a high tax environment, only those that really need the property will be motivated to hold it. Families would be a good example of a group that needs property, some place to live. In a low tax environment, speculation makes property values so high that people seeking homes have a hard time affording them.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how this translated to the real world so I looked around for examples. The most obvious such example was California's Proposition 13, which was passed in 1978 when I was only 12 years old. This not only lowered property taxes, but also increased property values as described above. Its effects were exactly what you would have predicted from the scenario generated in EVE Online. --- <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/20130405/189984/How_I_Used_EVE_Online_to_Predict_the_Great_Recession.php">Gamasutra: Ramin Shokrizade's Blog - How I Used EVE Online to Predict the Great Recession</a></p>
