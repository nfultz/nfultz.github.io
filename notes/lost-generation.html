<p>It is no wonder, then, that James Risen, national security correspondent for the New York Times, has been in legal jeopardy with two presidential administrations of different parties. His new book, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, is a chronicle of fascinating and heretofore secret stories in America’s war on terrorism. The book has a simple and arresting thesis: the longest war in America’s history is pure nirvana for the greedy and unscrupulous. Whatever the architects of the war on terrorism thoughtÂ they were doing, the Iraq War’s purpose rapidly evolved within the iron cage of the Washington public-private ecology into a rent-seeking opportunity for contractors and bureaucratic empire building for government employees. Its real, as opposed to ostensible, purpose seems to be endless, low-level war. The rote appeals to patriotism are just another way of mau-mauing critics. With a theme that attacks the underlying bipartisan consensus on terrorism of the last dozen years, it is no wonder the Justice Department once contemplated heaving Risen into federal prison. --- <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay_2015/on_political_books/operation_rent_seeking054219.php">Operation Rent Seeking by Mike Lofgren | The Washington Monthly</a></p>
<p>Among U.S. cities, Milwaukee has long been an outlier. In the late nineteenth century, it was the most foreign city in the country: By 1890, a mere 13 percent of its inhabitants were the children of American-born parents. For most of the period between 1910 and 1960, the city was governed by Socialist Party mayors. And, as the twentieth century wore on, Milwaukee stood apart for another reason: It remained remarkably and stubbornly white. The Great Migration that had brought some six million African Americans from the South between 1910 and 1930 and in a second wave around World War II transformed just about every major city in the North—except Milwaukee. --- <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118145/scott-walkers-toxic-racial-politics">Scott Walker's Toxic Racial Politics | The New Republic</a></p>
<p>There is hardly any major chaebol group that has not been rocked by a ‘war of princes’; it’s such a volatile issue that it’s a great blessing for Samsung and Hyundai that their current chairmen only had one son, said Lee Ji-soo, the director of the Law and Business Research Center in Seoul, which monitors chaebol. When investors demand better corporate governance at chaebol, they include transparency in succession plans.

<p>Rather than go to an expensive, elite program, a fiscally responsible student might be inclined to select a solid program with good funding in a cheap city. But academia was not designed for the fiscally responsible: It was designed for those for whom money is a nonissue. Academia’s currency is prestige, but prestige is always backed up by money, whether the expenditure for life in a costly city, the expectation of unpaid or underpaid labor, or research trips assumed to be paid out-of-pocket.  --- <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/929-academia-s-1-percent">Academia’s 1 Percent | Vitae</a></p>
<p>Will your Ph.D. lead to an academic job? To answer that question, prospective students are often encouraged to see how recent graduates fared -- a task easier said than done. Department placement lists are catalogs of untold stories, a logroll of the disappeared. Those who left academia are erased: According to my own alma mater, for example, I never existed, along with the majority of my colleagues who failed to find academic jobs in the Great Recession. There is no placement list for the displaced.  --- <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/929-academia-s-1-percent">Academia’s 1 Percent | Vitae</a></p>

<p>Antiwork is what we do out of love, fun, interest, talent, enthusiasm, inspiration, etc. Only a lucky few get paid enough from it to live on, yet it probably enriches our lives and benefits society more than most jobs do.</p>
<p>Our yearnings for antiwork remain largely unexpressed, as they don’t fit existing semantic frameworks. This is precisely why we need the concept. --- <a href="https://contributoria.com/issue/2014-12/543d1c2487628e9a6500001b">Antiwork – a radical shift in how we view jobs : December 2014 : Contributoria - the independent journalism network</a></p>

<p>Maria Fernandes worked three jobs at three different Dunkin’ Donuts stores in New Jersey. She napped when she could, often in her car between shifts. She tended to sleep with the engine running, and kept a container full of fuel in the back in case she ran out. On August 25, 2014, the container accidentally overturned and the car filled with fumes while she slept. Fernandes, 32, died there, still wearing her uniform.</p>
<p>Her death has been held up as a sign of the stresses facing America's low-wage workers, and the stresses that our jobs can put on our sleep. A new study by public health researchers at the University of Pennsylvania adds more evidence, suggesting that the main activity to which Americans sacrifice sleep is paid work.</p>
<p>And this sacrifice is not evenly distributed.  --- <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3043128/sleep-inequality">How Sleep Became A Social Justice Issue | Fast Company | Business   Innovation</a></p>
