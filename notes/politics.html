<p>US Senator and delicate southern flower Lindsey Graham has, in his own words, never sent an email in his life. He also just so happens to be a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law. Naturally.</p>
<p>The bizarre statement was made during Graham's appearance on Meet the Press earlier this morning, after host Chuck Todd asked the senator if he himself had a private email account (in reference to the recent Hilary Clinton debacle). To which Graham responded:</p>
<pre><code>I don't email. You can have every email I've ever sent. I've never sent one. [laughter] I don't know what that makes me.
</code></pre>
<p>Well, Senator, in addition to making you less technologically adept than the nation's legion of chain letter-loving racist grandfathers, it also makes you wildly unqualified to be deciding on anything related to internet policy. But then again, what else is new.

<p>I suggested a while ago that US politics is undergoing a realignment. The current GOP coalition is Capitalists and Christians, while the current Democratic coalition is Marxists and Minorities (painting with a very broad brush, exaggerated, etc). Within the GOP, the Capitalists and the Christians are already at war, with Trump somehow leading the Christian insurgency (ironically, since Trump is the least Christian-signalling of the candidates), while the Sanders campaign represents the confict between the Marxists and the Minorities.</p>
<p>But I suspect that we’re going to see a serious realignment into two new camps: the Populists and the Technocrats. The Populists will support the welfare state, nationalism, economic redistribution, and traditional morality and religion, while the Technocrats support free markets, racial egalitarianism, and innovative moralities and sexualities. The GOP will most likely become the Populists and its coalition will become the current Christians and Minorities, while the Dems will become the Technocrats and combine the current Capitalists and Marxists, somehow.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it will be even more obvious that the Technocrats actually run the country. My fondest long-term hope is that the technocratic elite ossifies into an actual aristocracy, and so learns something about noblesse oblige, but I’m not holding my breath. --- <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/23/a-whiter-shade-of-candidate/">A Whiter Shade of Candidate | Slate Star Codex</a></p>
