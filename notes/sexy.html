My old office-mate recently <a href=https://hitm.substack.com/p/bringing-sexy-back-to-data-science>[commented]</a> 
on the ten-year period between the old HBR
meme post and the current round of 'leaving data science' posts floating around. I
think it would be useful to revisit the 'sexiest job' meme, and track how it's changed
and put it in context. Or at least try to connect some threads about where this hype is 
coming from and show that it isn't great.


<h2>2008 - Varian </h2>

From the <a href=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/hal-varian-on-how-the-web-challenges-managers>McKinsey (yikes!) Quarterly</a>:

<blockquote>
	<h3> On workers and managers</h3>

<highlight>I keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians</highlight>. People think I’m joking, but who would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy job of the 1990s? The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids. Because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.

<p><highlight>I think statisticians are part of it, but it’s just a part</highlight>. You also want to be able to visualize the data, communicate the data, and utilize it effectively. But I do think those skills—of being able to access, understand, and communicate the insights you get from data analysis—are going to be extremely important. <highlight>Managers need to be able to access and understand the data themselves</highlight>.

<p>You always have this problem of being surrounded by “yes men” and people who want to predigest everything for you. In the old organization, you had to have this whole army of people digesting information to be able to feed it to the decision maker at the top. But that’s not the way it works anymore: the information can be available across the ranks, to everyone in the organization. And what you need to ensure is that people have access to the data they need to make their day-to-day decisions. And this can be done much more easily than it could be done in the past. And it really empowers the knowledge workers to work more effectively.
</blockquote>

Who: That was said by Hal Varian in October 2008. Hal Varian is a Professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information focusing on the Economics of Information. His 90s book <em>Information Rules</em> was extremely influential in dot-com circles for popularizing
'network effects', pricing information products, and locking in customers, and commoditizing the complements.
He is also the Chief Economist at Google. In 2008, Google
had purchased the DoubleClick online ad network for $3.1 billion. Also in 2008, the global economy collapsed. Millions of people lost their homes, and unemployment spiked into the double digits. To put it mildly, there were new pressures in many companies to do more with less.


<p>The three important parts, and some explication:

<ul>
<li> <highlight>I keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians</highlight>.

<p> Note that he doesn't say data scientist, and he doesn't say the entire 21st century. 
Statisticians already had the skills, and they had a ten year window to take advantage of their lead
while the rest of the economy caught up.

<li> <highlight>I think statisticians are part of it, but it’s just a part</highlight>.

<p> Varian is an econ guy, so some of his laundry list of "things that statisticians don't do" has
a bit of throwing stones, glass houses, etc - but - still largely true, many statisticians 
(<em>and</em> economists, <em>and</em> professors of both) are quite skilled at finding something 
"signficant" (whole other convo...) while stoping short of actually doing something, anything useful with it.  

<li> <highlight>Managers need to be able to access and understand the data themselves</highlight>.

<p> Here, he envisions a self-service model where statisticians / data-scientists are not needed at all,
and management can work directly with data themselves. The end-game here is a smarter 
CEO / MBA (McKinsey consultants included, presumably), not teams of highly paid specialists
working in-house on complicated projects of theoretical value.

</ul>


<h2>2009 - Rise of the "Data Scientist" </h2>

In the coming months, the above generated some buzz. 
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530074011/http://dataspora.com/blog/sexy-data-geeks>[Dataspora]</a> wrote:


<blockquote>
Statisticians’ sex appeal has little to do with their lascivious leanings (ahem, BedPost), and more with the scarcity of their skills.  I believe that the folks to whom Hal Varian is referring are not statisticians in the narrow sense, but rather people who possess skills in three key, yet independent areas:  statistics, data munging, and data visualization.  (In parentheses next to each, I’ve put the salient character trait needed to acquire it).
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
Put All Three Skills Together: Sexy. Thus with the Age of Data upon us, those who can model, munge, and visually communicate data — call us statisticians or data geeks — are a hot commodity.  I grew up before the age of geek chic, when the computer wizzes were social pariahs, and feature-length movies were dedicated to nerds seeking revenge.  But in the last decade, Steve Jobs became an icon, the Internet became cool, and an entire generation of tech kids grew up well adjusted.  They even built the social web to prove it.   I believe the same could happen to statistics and data geeks too.
</blockquote>

Michael Driscoll was the founder of dataspora, a boutique data consulting company in the Bay Area,
and later went on to co-found MetaMarkets (acquired by Snap). 
Side note - at the time, the dataspora page called its staff 
	<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307230955/http://dataspora.com>["Super Crunchers"]</a>[dataspora2] (that would change shortly)

<p>Next, 
	<a href=https://flowingdata.com/2009/06/04/rise-of-the-data-scientist>[Flowing Data]</a> responded:

<blockquote>
And after two years of highlighting visualization on FlowingData, it seems collaborations between the fields are growing more common, but more importantly, computational information design edges closer to reality. We’re seeing data scientists – people who can do it all – emerge from the rest of the pack.

<h3>Advantages of the Data Scientist</h3>

<p>Think about all the visualization stuff you’ve been most impressed with or the groups that always seem to put out the best work. Martin Wattenberg. Stamen Design. Jonathan Harris. Golan Levin. Sep Kamvar. Why is their work always of such high quality? Because they’re not just students of computer science, math, statistics, or graphic design.

<p>They have a combination of skills that not just makes independent work easier and quicker; it makes collaboration more exciting and opens up possibilities in what can be done. Oftentimes, visualization projects are disjoint processes and involve a lot of waiting. Maybe a statistician is waiting for data from a computer scientist; or a graphic designer is waiting for results from an analyst; or an HCI specialist is waiting for layouts from a graphic designer.

<p>Let’s say you have several data scientists working together though. There’s going to be less waiting and the communication gaps between the fields are tightened.

</blockquote>

<p>FlowingData is Nate Yau, (at the time) a PhD student at UCLA Statistics studying under Mark Hansen (side note - now at Columbia Journalism School). His blog on data visualization was about two years old at the time.

<p>The above quotes capture the ideas that a "data scientist" could "do it all" and are early examples of the 
now common overdone trope of "blog post of laundry list of things data scientists can do".


<p>The comments on Flowing Data are also significant:

<blockquote>
<h4>jeff — June 4, 2009 at 3:31 am</h4>
<p>i’m curious about how you chose the term “data scientist” to describe this role. that’s precisely the title we used for folks on the data team at facebook, chosen somewhat arbitrarily as a contraction of “data analyst” and “research scientist”, with the same skills in mind as you mention above. i also titled my chapter for “beautiful data” “information platforms and the rise of the data scientist”. quite amazing if you formulated the phrase separately! something in the air…

<h4>Nathan Yau — June 4, 2009 at 10:29 am</h4>
<p>@jeff – ha, yes, there must be something in the air. i read a grant proposal two or three years ago pushing for a new area of study called “data science.” it’s stuck with me ever since.

<h4>Michael E Driscoll — June 4, 2009 at 3:38 am</h4>
<p>Nathan – Nice synthesis and thanks for the shout-out. Ben Fry’s model captures the various fields that comprise this interdisciplinary ‘data science’ quite elegantly. I’d even venture to add some bidirectional arrows. Between the four core activities — Munging, Modeling, Visualizing, and Interacting — there’s a lot of feedback.

<p>And as far as sexiness goes, I’m still holding my breath for People magazine to release its Sexiest Data Scientist Alive issue. It still may be a decade or more away.
</blockquote>

<p>"jeff", in this case, is Jeff Hammerbacher, who had run the Facebook data team in 2006-2008ish, before going on to found Cloudera, 
a commercial vendor of the open source Hadoop data platform developed by Yahoo. The 
	<a href=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-data/9780596801656/ch05.html>[chapter]</a> he mentioned is available on O'Reilly:

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent interview, Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, highlighted the need for employees able to extract information from the Information Platforms described earlier. As Varian puts it, "find something where you provide a scarce, complementary service to something that is getting ubiquitous and cheap. So what's getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And what is complementary to data? Analysis."

<p>At Facebook, we felt that traditional titles such as Business Analyst, Statistician, Engineer, and Research Scientist didn't quite capture what we were after for our team. The workload for the role was diverse: on any given day, a team member could author a multistage processing pipeline in Python, design a hypothesis test, perform a regression analysis over data samples with R, design and implement an algorithm for some data-intensive product or service in Hadoop, or communicate the results of our analyses to other members of the organization in a clear and concise fashion. To capture the skill set required to perform this multitude of tasks, we created the role of "Data Scientist."
</blockquote>

<p>While "data science" had been "in the air" for a while - see Donaho's 
	<a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734>[50 years of data science]</a>, which cites Jeff Wu using the phrase
in the 80s - Hammerbacher is describing the earliest cases of a "data scientist" as an actual person that 
is hired to actually "do data science." And the fact that it's the founder of Cloudera writing in an O'Reilly book 
is significant in ways that an academic might not recognize.

<p>At that time (2008-9) Facebook was a red-hot company taking on MySpace (owned by Rupert Murdoch, Fox News, see also
danah boyd's 
	<a href=http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html>[article on Myspace vs FaceBook]</a>) by marketing to students at elite universities. The film 
"The Social Network" would be released in 2010 and Facebook would IPO in 2012. Similiarly, LinkedIn targeted
white collar workers.

<p>An aside on O'reilly: Evgeny Morozov's <a href=https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-meme-hustler>[takedown]</a> 
	is better written than anything I can produce, but 
I can add a couple thoughts on top. O'Reilly had come to prominance in the 90s as a publisher of 
manuals for free software, and played a large role in rebranding it "open source" to be more commercially friendly.
Following the dot-com collapse in Y2k, he began pushing "Web 2.0" as the next big thing. In 2009, in the midst
of another recession, he needed something new. "Data" would fit nicely: "big", "science" or other, didn't matter to him. 



<h2>2010 - Pre-Strata </h2>


<p>Going in to 2010, Oreilly started putting out red reports on data science.

<p>"What is a data scientist" by Loukides is <a href=http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html>[typical]</a>.
	
<p>	After the obligatory first sentence Varian quote, it proceeds:

<blockquote>
<p>According to DJ Patil, chief scientist at LinkedIn (@dpatil), the best data scientists tend to be "hard scientists," particularly physicists, rather than computer science majors. Physicists have a strong mathematical background, computing skills, and come from a discipline in which survival depends on getting the most from the data. They have to think about the big picture, the big problem. When you’ve just spent a lot of grant money generating data, you can’t just throw the data out if it isn’t as clean as you'd like. You have to make it tell its story. You need some creativity for when the story the data is telling isn’t what you think it’s telling.
</blockquote>

<p>DJ Patil will be coming up later. He goes on:

<blockquote>
<p>Entrepreneurship is another piece of the puzzle. <highlight>Patil’s first flippant answer to "what kind of person are you looking for when you hire a data scientist?” was “someone you would start a company with."</highlight> That’s an important insight: we’re entering the era of products that are built on data. We don’t yet know what those products are, but we do know that the winners will be the people, and the companies, that find those products. Hilary Mason came to the same conclusion. Her job as scientist at bit.ly is really to investigate the data that bit.ly is generating, and find out how to build interesting products from it. No one in the nascent data industry is trying to build the 2012 Nissan Stanza or Office 2015; they’re all trying to find new products. In addition to being physicists, mathematicians, programmers, and artists, they’re entrepreneurs.

<p>Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: “here’s a lot of data, what can you make from it?”
</blockquote>


<p>Many people are familiar with Drew Conway's "Venn Diagram of Data Science," which includes Hacking, Math, and Substantive Expertise.

<img src=https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5150aec6e4b0e340ec52710a/1364352051365-HZAS3CLBF7ABLE3F5OBY/Data_Science_VD.png?format=750w />

<p>There's also a comical danger zone that I like.

But, in the <a href=http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram>[actual post]</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>On Monday I—humbly—joined a group of NYC's most sophisticated thinkers on all things data for a <highlight>half-day unconference to help O'Reily organize their upcoming Strata conference</<highlight>. The break out sessions were fantastic, and the number of people in each allowed for outstanding, expert driven, discussions. One of the best sessions I attended focused on issues related to teaching data science, which inevitably led to a discussion on the skills needed to be a fully competent data scientist.
</blockquote>

<p> Strata was Oreilly's new conference in 2011 on AI and Data, largely sponsored by vendors like Cloudera. O'Reilly had
pivoted from $40 computer manuals to $2000 conference tickets. 
	
<p> It was also the first real coordinated industry effort to "make" "data science" a "thing."	

<h2> 2012 - Sexiest Job Redux </h2>

By 2012, DJ Patil has moved on from LinkedIn to be a Data Scientist in Residence at GreyLock Partners ("Greylock Partners, an early-stage venture firm that has backed companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Palo Alto Networks, and Workday, is worried enough about the tight labor pool that it has built its own specialized recruiting team to channel talent to businesses in its portfolio").

<p>Writing for the <a href=https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century>[Harvard Business Review]</a>:

<blockquote>

<h3>Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century</h3>

<p>Meet the people who can coax treasure out of messy, unstructured data. by Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil

<p> It’s a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data. The title has been around for only a few years. (It was coined in 2008 by one of us, D.J. Patil, and Jeff Hammerbacher, then the respective leads of data and analytics efforts at LinkedIn and Facebook.) But thousands of data scientists are already working at both start-ups and well-established companies. Their sudden appearance on the business scene reflects the fact that companies are now wrestling with information that comes in varieties and volumes never encountered before. If your organization stores multiple petabytes of data, if the information most critical to your business resides in forms other than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your biggest question would involve a “mashup” of several analytical efforts, you’ve got a big data opportunity.
</blockquote>


Now I can't be sure they picked the title themselves or if an editor punched it up, but pay attention: it's no longer "statisticians" and it's no longer just "ten years". 

They continue:

<blockquote>
<h3>The Hot Job of the Decade</h3>
<p>Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, is known to have said, "The sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. People think I’m joking, but who would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy job of the 1990s?"

<p>If "sexy" means having rare qualities that are much in demand, data scientists are already there. They are difficult and expensive to hire and, given the very competitive market for their services, difficult to retain. <highlight>There simply aren’t a lot of people with their combination of scientific background and computational and analytical skills</highlight>.

<p>Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street "quants" of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed master’s programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs.

<p><highlight>One question raised by this is whether some firms would be wise to wait until that second generation of data scientists emerges, and the candidates are more numerous, less expensive, and easier to vet and assimilate in a business setting. Why not leave the trouble of hunting down and domesticating exotic talent to the big data start-ups and to firms like GE and Walmart, whose aggressive strategies require them to be at the forefront?</highlight>

<p>The problem with that reasoning is that the advance of big data shows no signs of slowing. If companies sit out this trend’s early days for lack of talent, they risk falling behind as competitors and channel partners gain nearly unassailable advantages. Think of big data as an epic wave gathering now, starting to crest. If you want to catch it, you need people who can surf.

</blockquote>

<p>Again, the main reason data scientists are desirable is the scarcity. But even they acknowledge that was changing: "This may be less true in five years’ time, when many more people will have the title 'data scientist' on their business cards."

<p>This being HBR, the main audience is managment - it serves to advertise how great a data scientist is and how they'll help
you business; eg Better hire one now! You don't want to miss out!


<h2> 2014 - Cloudera </h2>

<p>You probably remember this tweet making the rounds, good for a laugh:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco&quot; <a href="https://t.co/NAftOI9jmJ">pic.twitter.com/NAftOI9jmJ</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/smc90?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smc90</a></p>&mdash; cdixon.eth (@cdixon) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/428914681911070720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But you can watch the actual talk:
	
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAkIJi5GHEM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	
<p>The speaker is Sean Owens, then a Director at Cloudera, giving "Sharing Data Science, Factories vs Labs". This is one of the 
early instances of concerns of "productionalization" (a yech word) and "deployment".

<p>And I largely agree with the specific things he is saying. Like Varian originally said, doing something useful is the point. 
	
	
	<p>But, as a metaphor, the "factory" is de-skilled and de-personalized:
	replacing the "lab" "genius" "scientist" with a "factory" "worker" "engineer", where the labor is
	interchangeable and replaceable and less important than the machinery. 
	
	<h2> 2015 and further - Followups </h2>

	<ul>
    <li> 2015 - DJ Patil is appointed Chief Data Scientist of America by Barack Obama.
	<li> 2015 - "50 years of Data Science" by Donaho is released. 
	<li> 2015 - Sean Owens responds to Donaho (also on youtube)
	<li> 2017 - Cloudera IPO
	<li> 2018 - Cambridge Analytica / FaceBook scandal
	<li> 2020 - COVID and resulting lockdowns and recessions
	<li> 2020 - O'Reilly cancels Strata 2020, lays off entire event planning staff
	<li> 2021 - Cloudera taken private after losing marketshare to AWS for several years
	</ul>
	
	
<h2>Ads?</h2>

<p>The initial germ of the "Data Science is sexy" meme came from Google, Facebook, LinkedIn - all ad companies. 
	This is not a coincidence.	
	
<p> Thomas Frank's <em>Conquest of Cool</em> (or some episodes of Mad Men, TBH) describes the tension in advertising a generation ago
	between the 'creatives' and the 'suits' - advertising was highly quantitative in the 1950s. This tension has always been
	a part of the culture of business, the calls were coming from inside the house, but in periods of social unrest and economic
	decline, parts of the business community can line up with outside forces ("synergy" lol). Whether the non-conformist minority
	avails itself of creativity or (psuedo-)science does not really matter.
	
<p> If the analogy holds, it's not surprising that some data scientists had some big wins in ad companies during the 2008 collapse,
	but that doesn't mean those wins can be replicated, any more than the "magic" of the  VW ads or Pepsi Generation. 
	But, companies will certainly spend millions trying.

<p> A big difference is that the early winners spun off their own companies, like Cloudera, or started selling
	courses and books instead of just doing the work, and that created an ecosystem of vendors, influencers and
	publishers. 
	
<h2> Tieing it together</h2>
	
<p> So that's a lot of old stuff to digest, so I made my own Venn diagram:	
	
<p>	<img src=Influencers.png height=300px width=400px />
	
<p> There are three reinforcing components to this hype cycle:
	
<p> <em>Influencers</em> (eg DJ Patil) benefit - if "data science is sexy" and he is a "data scientist", well, you do the modus ponens. 
	They are hired by vendors to work on products, and paid by publishers to write books and speak at conferences. 
	
<p> <em>Vendors</em> (eg Cloudera) - They sell products to companies. They hire influencers as instant social proof that their product is good,
	and rely on publishers to train customers' employees to use their products. The ultimateir goal is to "lock in" the customer.
<p> <em>Publishers</em> (eg O'reilly) - They sell books, courses, and conference tickets - the influencers provide the content and the vendors the ads.
	
<p>They say in a gold rush, sell shovels. The Vendors and Publishers are the shovel sellers. 
	
<p>When HBR says, to management, to hire a data scientist *now*, don't miss out, that's a sales pitch. But if a company had gone all-in
hiring a data scientist and implementing a big data stack in 2012, they may well have been locked in to the Cloudera
Hadoop stack for *years*, even though an RDBMS was probably sufficient for many companies. And because of that lock-in,
maybe they missed out on migrating to the cloud (AWS etc).
	
<p>And if the employees are too hard to hire, well, Cloudera can sell you a factory now, who needs a lab?
	

<h2>Alienation In Data Science</h2>

<p> Notably absent from the machine described above is the actual people doing the work of data science; 
they are the ones being alienated from their work.	
	
<p>	Some people (medium...) describe the alienation in vague terms and argue for grit as a solution,
	misses the element that the expectations placed on workers did not come from the workers - it comes from actors
	in the ecosystem. And when Hadoop fails to deliver any value, the workers are blamed, not the vendors -
	essentially they are saying "you just weren't enough of a genius to make Hadoop do anything useful" when Hadoop
	was never the right solution in the first place.

<p> So the logic of the hype is weaponized against the data scientist.	
	
<p> Side note: While I like that Josh's post correctly places the blame on management when data science fails,
	the answer is probably not more management, although that's how things tend to play out. 
	If the problem can't be solved with Hadoop, then Jira ain't helping neither.	
		
<h2> Conclusions </h2>	
	
<ul>
<li> After 15 years of "data scientists", the job is stilessentially chimaeric, trying to be everything to everyone.
	
<li> From my perspective, the only thing a worker can do, hopefully ride the hype cycle up, but move on before it's too late.
	
<li> Varian's ten years was up in 2018; the sexiest job of the 21st century is not data science. God help us all if it turns out to be bitcoin, though. 	
	
<li> The job isn't like the advertising because those ads exist to make managers buy computer software licenses,
	and they need to hire people to operate it - who then needs courses, books, conferences etc.

<li> The data scientist was always envisioned as a temporary means to an end, and was to be disintermediated. 
	as soon as self-service became a feasible option. There was never suppossed to be large teams of specialists
	doing god knows what to numbers.

<li> Automation continues to advance, still largely driven by the fringes.	
	
<li> But just as turbo tax hasn't killed accounting, data scientists will find niches in a 
	post-automated landscape. "Life finds a way."
	
</ul>
	
<p> Anyways, the more time you spend drinking kool aid, or critiquing it, the less you spend on actually fixing problems. So to return to Josh's original point, no, let's not bring back the sexy meme.
