## Esoterica

[The Strange Autobiography of Frank B. Robinson](http://www.johnblack.com/psychiana/strange/index.html)

The Waite Rider pack references Egyptian, Christian and Greek myths and, in A History of the Occult Tarot, Ronald Decker and the late Michael Dummett describe how a whole fake history of the Tarot was constructed by a series of 19th-century occultists who claimed to trace its legend back as far as ancient Egypt. It is not always clear how much these fantasists believed their own fakery, but for many the manufactured legends were – and still are – as compelling as those of Christianity. --- [Atheists can embrace the power of Tarot | New Humanist](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2758/atheists-can-embrace-the-power-of-tarot)
