<p>A striking section of Elizabeth Warren’s memoir is about advice she says Larry Summers once offered her:</p>
<p>After dinner, Larry leaned back in his chair and offered me some advice, Ms. Warren writes. I had a choice. I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People — powerful people — listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don’t criticize other insiders.</p>
