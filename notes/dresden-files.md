<!-- njnmdoc:  title="Dresden Files"  -->
The Dresden Files is a series of urban fantasy novels by Jim Butcher. They follow the wizard-detective Harry Dresden through his worst day of each year.

Butcher takes an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach to fantasy, with his universe including not only nigh-immortal wizards, but also multiple types of vampires, werewolves, fairies, demons, angels, and aliens.

Good Times.
