<p>RadioShack is trying to auction off its customer data on some 117 million
customers as part of its court-supervised bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The data in question, according to a legal challenge (PDF) launched by Texas
regulators on Friday and joined by the state of Tennessee on Monday, includes
&quot;consumer names, phone numbers, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and, where
allowed, activity data.&quot;</p>
<p>The states say the sale breaches the 94-year-old chain's promises to its
in-store and online customers that it would not sell their personal identifying
information (PII) data.

<p>Among their suggestions to boost transparency and corporate openness are —</p>
<p>Public interest organizations and government agencies developing clear definitions of transparency that reflect consumer concerns, and then systematically calling out companies regarding how well or badly they are doing based on these values, in order to help consumers ‘vote with their wallets’</p>
<p>Activities to dissect and report on the implications of privacy policies — perhaps aided by crowdsourced initiatives — so that complex legalize is interpreted and implications explained for a consumer audience, again allowing for good practice to be praised (and vice versa)</p>
<p>Advocating for consumers to gain access to the personal profiles companies create on them in order for them to understand how their data is being used</p>
