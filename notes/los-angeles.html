<p>Trystero offers an espresso roast as well as a roast suitable for brewed coffee, but the temperature difference between those two is slight. Thomas said he shoots for a slightly more caramelized and sweet taste for the espresso. Most of his green beans are bought from Coffee Shrub, a subsidiary of Sweet Maria. Thomas roasts on Tuesdays and Thursdays, going through a 50-pound bag each week. </p>

<p>To protect their groves from the freezing temperatures, growers initially turned to smudge pots. David Boulé, whose extensive collection of postcards, souvenirs, orange-themed curios, and other items explores the relationship between the orange and the myth of California, explains:</p>
<pre><code>For almost sixty years, growers used oil-burning smudge pots to produce a dense smoke and prevent crop damage from frost. In 1947, the State of California passed legislation outlawing many types of smudge pots. Research showed that a movement of air at from five to seven miles an hour created by wind machines was a superior way to prevent frost from forming.
</code></pre>
<p>The smudge pots saved the oranges but devastated the air quality, foreshadowing the region's later struggles with smog --- <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/earth-water-air-fire-a-historical-look-at-socals-troubled-relationship-with-the-four-classical-eleme.html">Earth, Water, Air, Fire: A Historical Look at SoCal's Troubled Relationship with Nature | LA as Subject | SoCal Focus | KCET</a></p>
