How to Fix "Authentication is required to create a color profile/managed device"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from https://devanswers.co/how-to-fix-authentication-is-required-to-create-a-color-profile-managed-device-on-ubuntu-20-04-20-10/

The safest fix to get rid of these popups is to create a new configuration file in `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/02-allow-colord.conf`.

```
sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/02-allow-colord.conf
```

Paste in the following:

/etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/02-allow-colord.conf

```
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
 if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-device" ||
 action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.create-profile" ||
 action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-device" ||
 action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.delete-profile" ||
 action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-device" ||
 action.id == "org.freedesktop.color-manager.modify-profile") &&
 subject.isInGroup("{users}")) {
 return polkit.Result.YES;
 }
});
```

Save and exit (press `CTRL` + `X`, press `Y` and then press `ENTER`)

This tells Polkit to continue without requiring the authentication prompt over RDP.

Now reboot Ubuntu and try logging in again over RDP / Windows Remote Desktop and the popups should be gone.



## Configuring a monitor with non-standard resolutions

First, use `gtf` to calculate the mode line

```
gtf 1024 600 60
```

Then, create a new mode, add it to the output device, and activate it.


```
xrandr --newmode "1024x600_60.00"  48.96  1024 1064 1168 1312  600 601 604 622  -HSync +Vsync
xrandr --addmode HDMI-A-0 "1024x600_60.00"
xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --mode "1024x600_60.00"
```


## Mirroring from s3 to ftp

  * Launch ec2 node
      * in same region as bucket, for free transfer
      * Need not be too large, this will be IO/network bound
  * Mount s3 bucket using s3fs
      * Tricky if there is a dot in the bucket name, must `use_path_request_style`
      * If not in us-east-1, most override region
      * Set umask or only root will have permissions
      * `s3fs -o use_path_request_style -o iam_role -o url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com -o umask=022 -o endpoint=us-west-2 <bucketname> <mountpoint>`
  * recursive copy using `ncftp`
      * `mput -R .`

## USB HDMI capture

  * `sudo apt install guvcview`
  * `guvcview` to start video capture
  * For audio, there seems to be quite a bit of lag when muxing with video. Instead, open the two streams independently.
    * Find source in `pactl list sources | grep name`
    * Open pulse audio stream in VLC: `vlc pulse://alsa_input.usb-VXIS_Inc_FHD_Capture-02.iec958-stereo`

## ClamAV from source

  * Get tarball and install:
      * `./configure`
      * `make`
      * `sudo checkinstall` - choose 'don't copy' for files in build and home dir
  * `sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib`
  * `sudo cp /usr/local/etc/freshclam.conf{.sample,}`
      * Edit
  * make shared folder:
      * `sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/clamav`
      * `sudo chgrp 130 /usr/local/share/clamav`
      * `sudo chmod 776 /usr/local/share/clamav`
  * `sudo freshclam` to update virus defs

## Cisco AnyConnect VPN

  * `sudo apt install network-manager-openconnect-gnome`
  * Start `nm-applet` - this may require the gnome-tweak to show indicators
      * https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1394977
  * Better debugging:
```
sudo nmcli general logging level TRACE
journalctl -u NetworkManager --since '2 minutes ago'
```

## FoxyProxy config

  * Add New Proxy
      * host - "localhost"
      * port - 9999
      * Socks Proxy checked, SOCKS v5 selected
      * Add rule *neal-nuc*
  * ssh -D 9999 nfultz@neal.nuc
  * visit http://neal-nuc:8787 from chrome

## Enable Bluetooth at boot

  * From [TomTom](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/199088/50441):
  * Add to /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules :
```
 # Set bluetooth power up
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hci0", RUN+="/usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 up"
```

## Fix crackling audio on HDMI

  * From [Gav](https://askubuntu.com/questions/405071/static-and-crackling-in-my-hdmi-audio):
  * Edit /etc/pulse/default.pa :
```
# add tsched=0 to udev-detect
load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0
```
  * Other people indicate this might affect ATI specifically.

## Awesome CLI tools

  * epr
    - An epub reader.
    - `pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/wustho/epr.git`
  * ranger
    - An file browser for the terminal
    - `pip3 install --user ranger-fm`
  * pdfbook
    - convert a pdf into a booklet for (double-sided) printing
    - `apt install texlive-extra-utils`
  * [savepagenow](https://github.com/pastpages/savepagenow)
    - saves url to wayback machine
    - `pip3 install --user savepagenow`
  * [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
    - scrapes video from youtube
    - `pip3 install --user youtube-dl`
  * [ledger](https://plaintextaccounting.org/)
    - plain text double-entry accouting
    - `apt install ledger`
  * [horcrux](https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux)

### Old awesome commands

## Openvpn

```
sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
```

Need to reboot!

## Grepping for user cron

```
journalctl | grep --line-buffered -Ei "cron\[[0-9]*\]:\s*\($USER\)"
```

use `--line-buffered` to avoid double-buffer delay.

## Old Crunchbang notes



CrunchBang, at [crunchbang.org](http://crunchbang.org) was a [[Debian]]-based [[Linux]] distribution.

It is built with low overhead in mind, making it ideal for modest PCs such as [[netbooks]].

At it's core, it is really just a debian install with good defaults for

[[OpenBox]] - window manager

[[tint2]] - panel

[[conky]] - system info dashboard - Crunchbang lists the OB shortcuts

[A eulogy to CrunchBang, the Linux distro that time passed by | PCWorld](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2882630/the-death-of-a-linux-distro.html#tk.nl_today)


### Creating USB
Default "Create startup USB" in ubuntu did not worked,
installed unetbin, which did.

Set up on laptop. Flash and wireless worked out of box.

### Iceweasel
* Set up quicksearches, changed homepage to ddg,
* get delicious bookmarklet
* Get extensions:
  * RightBar
  * Scrollbar Anywhere
  * TreeStyle Tab
  * Tab History Redux
 in about:config set browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground to false.
* Elite proxy switcher is decent too for SOCKS 5 proxy over ssh.


### SSD Notes

Since using an ssd, I did not install a swap partition.

* Therefore, remove the swap line from .conkyrc

### Wlan tweak

Added wlan0 status to conkyrc:

     ESSID: $alignr ${wireless_essid wlan0} ${wireless_link_qual_perc wlan0}%



### Wallpaper Hack

`~/bin/rotate2` is a script for switching desktops

```
     #/bin/sh
     DIR=${1:-~/images/wallpapers}
     FILE=$DIR/$(ls -1tr $DIR | head -n 1)
     touch "$FILE"
     nitrogen --set-zoom-fill "$FILE"
```

`nitrogen` is obviously the command which does the desktop

It is invoked by conky:

    ${execi 222 ~/bin/rotate2}

10/28 : Need this line for conky for fixing
background problems.

    own_window_argb_visual yes

Also added battery meter.

#### Minor stuff

* Set panel to autohide:

    edit .config/tint2, set autohide = 1

* Move notify to bottom right.

    gconftool-2 -s /apps/notify-osd/gravity --type=int 3

  then logout and back in.

### Notes from Setting up desktop

Setting up SSD was major pain in the ass, BIOS was defaulting
to IDE emulation and the drive was failing inconsistently
eg ldconfig failures (Invalid ELF; missing magic bytes) and
and segfaulting iceweasel, flash, vim, xterm, everything.

Went through several reinstalls to get it working right. Trick
was to switch it to AHCI.


### Fstab editing
  Because I wanted to still use my old hard drive, two
problems came up:

1) mount it automatically to ~/prev-drive

2) have #! use the HDD swap partition instead of the SSD

Both are accomplished by adding the devices to fstab
along with mount points.

  Since the last time I did this, things have changed, now
you refer to drives by UUID, which you can get out
of blkid

### Grub Editing

  Also, GRUB added all the old drives Ubuntu entries
to the the list, there was ~30 of them. To get rid of them
I commented them out from /boot/grub/grub.cfg; and to make
sure they don't come back, I removed execute permission from
/etc/grub.d/30_os_probe

    sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.ed/30_os_probe

There might be a better way to do this. Also, I had to run
the grub update script once with os probing to get settings
for windows, which I then copied into a diff file (40_win)

###Mcabber

This didn't seem to work until installing TLS libraries.


###Latex

To install Lecture Notes in CS Springer style, unzip llncs2e.zip to

/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/llncs2e/

and then rebuild the style database:

    $sudo mktexlsr

I installed the uclathes template there similiarly, by git clone-ing it into
the above directory and rebuilding.


###SSH Shared Keys

first, generate the key

    $ ssh-keygen

then, add it to ssh-agent

    $ ssh-add

check that it is there

    $ ssh-add -L

finally, send it on over

    $ ssh-copy-id remote

Make sure that .ssh is chmod 700 and .ssh/id_rsa is chmod 66

Make sure public key auth is turned on in /etc/ssh/sshd_config


### Text Utils

A couple utils I like for text:

  * boxes
  * figlet
  * pv -pipe view

### Stripping shoutcast streams

     git://src.thregr.org/fIcy

 make and then copy to ~/bin

# Old SUSE Notes

Start with server text only install

Follow these:

http://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/lightweight-opensuse-lxde-desktop-from-scratch/

```
# zypper install xorg-x11 xorg-x11-server
# startx

# zypper install openbox
```

need Mesa-GL, x drivers for ati and evdev, xorg-video-drivers


http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Administer_with_sudo

```
# zypper in sudo
# visudo
// add line %sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
# groupadd sudo
# usermod -a -G sudo neal
```

I don't have man pages, wtf

    sudo zypper in --no-recommends man

apparently man reccomends ghostscript, which is not needed right now.

```
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/openSUSE_12.3/X11:lxde.repo

zypper in slim

 ? reccommends ImageMagic ??

zypper in yast2-sysconfig yast2-runlevel

edit /etc/logins.def, remove offending LASTLOG_ENAB

in yast2-runlevel, enable xdm


however, changing systemd default runlevel is a bit more involved:

ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target \
   /etc/systemd/system/default.target

zypper in pulseaudio pavucontrol

zypper in MozillaFirefox
zypper in flash-player


zypper in mercurial

### GNOME

#### Set an Always on Top keyboard shortcut on GNOME desktop

from https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/12/how-to-use-keyboard-shortcut-to-toggle.html

GNOME doesn't have a default keyboard shortcut for Always on Top any more (it used to have Alt + Space, then t), but there is an option to set your own keyboard shortcut for this window feature. The option is not exposed in Settings - > Keyboard Shortcuts though.

Dconf Editor Always on Top

To access the option that allows setting a keyboard shortcut for Always on Top, open Dconf Editor and go to /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings. There, set a keyboard shortcut for always-on-top in this form (example): ['<Alt>1'], ['<Control>2'], ['<Control><Shift>a'] and so on, but obviously, set it to what you want to use for this. Disable the "Use default value" toggle to be able to enter a shortcut.
