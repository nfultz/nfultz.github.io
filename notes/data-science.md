<h2>Data Science Realism 101</h2>

You need a plan for responsibly collecting and securing data:

<ul>

<li>The business needs a plan for building the capabilities and infrastructure to turn that data into insights to drive positive business outcomes

<li>The plan needs to have measurable ROI that stakeholders agree upon up front

<li>You need a campaign to teach the talent what to expect and why the migration to data driven will improve the business

<li>Everyone needs to be accountable for their part in executing the data strategy

[The Model Complexity Myth](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/07/06/model-complexity-myth/)

## Big Data

> The thing that separates a potentially new crisis in the area of so-called Big-Data from these earlier ones is that, literally overnight, we have reconstructed much of our economy, national security infrastructure and in the process of eroding our ancient right privacy on it’s yet to be proven premises. Now, we are on the verge of changing not just the nature of the science upon which we all depend, but nearly every other field of human intellectual endeavor. And we’ve done and are doing this despite the fact that the the most over the top promises of Big Data are about as epistemologically grounded as divining the future by looking at goat entrails. --- [Big Data as statistical masturbation](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/searle20150208)
