<article><p>So to all non-technical professionals looking to get technical: If you want to become a software engineer, by all means learn Ruby or go through the Javascript tutorials on Codecademy. But if you’re simply a business professional looking to gain an edge on your peers, trust me, you are much better off learning R [1]. --- <a href="https://medium.com/@LeadaTeam/why-are-you-learning-to-code-d4ed5eae9660">Why are YOU learning to code? — Medium</a></p>

<p>I decided the best thing to do was to drop out and start an apprenticeship as a Fachinformatiker - computer programmer. This might sound like a stupid decision to people in North America, who often go to College or University to get a degree in something like computer science, but in Germany leaving high-school for an apprenticeship is not out of the ordinary. It is called the dual education system, and it is likely one of the main reasons for Germany’s success. --- <a href="http://tobi.lutke.com/blogs/news/11280301-the-apprentice-programmer">The Apprentice Programmer – Too-biased</a></p>
<p>Many professions require some form of computer programming. Accountants program spreadsheets and word processors; photographers program photo editors; musicians program synthesizers; and professional programmers instruct plain computers. Programming has become a required skill.</p>
<p>Yet programming is more than just a vocational skill. Indeed, good programming is a fun activity, a creative outlet, and a way to express abstract ideas in a tangible form. And designing programs teaches a variety of skills that are important in all kinds of professions: critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail.</p>
