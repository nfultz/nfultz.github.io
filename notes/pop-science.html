<article><p>when listening to Moms’ criticism, and for a period afterwards, the teens’ brains showed more activity in areas involved in negative emotions (no surprise there), but they actually showed reduced activity in regions involved in emotional control and in taking other people’s point of view --- <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/teen-brain-shuts-hears-moms-criticism/">The Teen Brain Shuts Down When It Hears Mom’s Criticism | WIRED</a></p>
<p>The project lost a huge amount of credibility — and a huge amount of grant funding — because people got overly excited about a story they hadn’t bothered to check out.</p>
<p>And that’s just one example. A very similar thing happened to artificial intelligence research in 1973, when an investigator named James Lighthill published a scathing report in one of the field’s most widely-read scientific journals, claiming that A.I. research wasn’t living up to expectations. Which expectations were those, exactly? As it turned out, mostly expectations created by overexcited media advocates — in other words, the exact same kind of fluff that Facebook loves today --- <a href="https://medium.com/@writingben/a-disease-of-scienceyness-7b5571a34953">A Disease of Scienceyness — Mix Tape — Medium</a></p>

<p>And if the holes are found at a certain energy, it could prove the controversial theory of ‘rainbow gravity’ which suggests that the universe stretches back into time infinitely with no singular point where it started, and no Big Bang.</p>
<p>The theory was postulated to reconcile Einstein’s theory of general relativity – which deals with very large objects, and quantum mechanics – which looks at the tiniest building blocks of the universe. It takes its name from a suggestion that gravity's effect on the cosmos is felt differently by varying wavelengths of light. --- <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/large-hadron-collider/11489442/Big-Bang-theory-could-be-debunked-by-Large-Hadron-Collider.html">Big Bang theory could be debunked by Large Hadron Collider - Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Not hitting below the belt, then, protects the idea that men’s bodies are fighting machines. It protects masculinity, the very idea that men are big and strong, pain- and impact-resistant, impenetrable like an edifice. So not hitting below the belt doesn’t just protect individual men from pain, it protects our ideas about masculinity.</p>
<p>When a man hits below the belt, he is revealing to everyone present that masculinity is a fiction. That’s why one guy said: For ‘alpha male’ fights, nut shots are just wrong. Alpha male fights are about figuring out which male is alpha, while preserving the idea that the alpha male is a thing that matters. --- <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/03/02/why-dont-men-kick-each-other-in-the-balls/">Why Don’t Men Kick Each Other in the Balls? » Sociological Images</a></p>
<p>Now, 15 years after the ACE study came out, some scientists are trying to connect the dots — to get a clearer picture of what exactly adverse childhood experiences do to the body and why the study results came out the way they did.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you've reshaped the biology of the child,&quot; says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychologist at the University of Minnesota who, for more than 30 years, has been studying the ways children respond to stressful experiences. &quot;This is how nature protects us,&quot; Gunnar adds. We all become adapted to living in &quot;the kinds of environments we're born into.&quot;</p>
<p>And if you have scary, traumatic experiences when you're small, Gunnar says, your stress response system may, in some cases, be programmed to overreact, influencing the way your mind and body work together. Research in animals and people suggests that the part of the mind that scientists call &quot;executive function&quot; — thought, judgment, self-control — seems to be most affected, she says. --- <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/03/02/377569413/can-family-secrets-make-you-sick">Can Family Secrets Make You Sick? : Shots - Health News : NPR</a></p>
