<p>&quot;Two men sat opposite me once, despising each other so heartily that I am
unlikely to forget them. They had never met before—if they can be said to have
met this time—and they were both unknown to me. It happened in a train by which
we journeyed together from Leamington to London. The cause of their mutual
disesteem was appearance; neither liked the other's outward man, and told him
so silently for three hours; that is all they ever knew of each other. This
object-lesson afterward gained greatly by my learning the name and estate of
one of these gentlemen. He was a peer.  He had good rugs, a good umbrella,
several newspapers—but read only the pink one,—and a leather and silver thing
which I took to be a travelling-bag beside him. He opened it between Banbury
and Oxford, and I saw, not handkerchiefs and ivory, but cut-glass bottles with
stoppers. I noticed further the strong sumptuous monogram engraved here and
there. The peer leisurely took brandy, and was not aware of our presence. But
the point of him is that he garnished those miles of railroad with incomparably
greater comfort than we did who had no rugs, no cut glass, no sandwich-box, no
monogram. He had understood life's upholstery and trappings for several hundred
years, getting the best to be had in each generation of his noble descent.</p>
<p>The enemy that he had made, as a dog makes an enemy of a cat by the mere
preliminary of being a dog, sat in the other corner. He wore a shiny silk hat,
smooth new lean black trousers, with high boots stiff and swelling to
stove-pipe symmetry beneath, and a tie devoid of interest. I did not ascertain
if the pistol was in his hip pocket, but at stated intervals he spit out of his
window. By his hawk nose and eye and the lank strength of his chin he was a
male who could take care of himself, and had done so. One could be sure he had
wrested success from this world somehow, somewhere; and here he was, in a
first-class carriage, on a first-class train, come for a first-class time, with
a mind as complacently shut against being taught by foreign travel as any
American patriot of to-day can attain or recommend, or any Englishman can
reveal in his ten-day book about our continent and people. Charles Dickens and
Mark Twain have immortalized their own blindness almost equally; and the sad
truth is that enlightenment is mostly a stay-at-home creature, who crosses
neither ocean nor frontier. This stranger was of course going to have a bad
time, and feel relieved to get home and tell of the absence of baggage-checks
and of the effete despot who had not set up the drinks. Once he addressed the
despot, who was serenely smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll trouble you for a light,&quot; said he; and in his drawl I heard plainly his
poor opinion of feudalism.</p>
<p>His lordship returned the drawl—not audibly, but with his eye, which he ran
slowly up and down the stranger. His was the Piccadilly drawl; the other made
use of the trans-Missouri variety; and both these are at bottom one and the
same —the Anglo-Saxon's note of eternal contempt for whatever lies outside the
beat of his personal e.xperience. So I took an observation of these two
Anglo-Saxons drawling at each other across the prejudice of a hundred years,
and I thought it might come to a row. For the American was, on the quiet face
of him, a &quot;bad man,&quot; and so, to any save the provincial eye, was the nobleman.
Fine feathers had deceived trans-Missouri, whose list of &quot;bad men&quot; was limited
to specimens of the cut of his own jib, who know nothing of cut-glass bottles.
But John gave Jonathan the light he asked, and for the remainder of our journey
ceased to know that such a person existed.</p>
<p>Though we three never met again, my object-lesson did not end when we parted at
Paddington. Before many seasons were sped the fortunes of tbe nobleman took a
turn for the scandalous. He left cut glass behind him and went to Texas.  I
wish I could veraciously tell that he saw the stranger there—the traveller
between whose bird-of-freedom nostrils and the wind his luxurious nobility had
passed so offensively. But I do know that his second and more general skirmish
with democracy left both sides amicable. In fact, the nobleman won the Western
heart forthwith. Took it by surprise: democracy had read in the papers so often
about the despot and his effeteness. This despot vaulted into the saddle and
stuck to the remarkably ingenious ponies that had been chosen with care to
disconcert him. When they showed him pistols, he was found to be already
acquainted with that weapon. He quickly learned how to rope a steer. The card
habit ran in his noble blood as it did in the cowboy's. He could sleep on the
ground and rough it with the best of them, and with the best of them he could
drink and help make a town clamorous. Deep in him lay virtues and vices coarse
and elemental as theirs. Doubtless the windows of St. James Street sometimes
opened in his memory, and he looked into them and desired to speak with those
whom he saw inside. And the whiskey was not like the old stuff in the
cut-glass bottles; but he never said so; and in time he died, widely esteemed.
Texas found no count against him save his pronunciation of such words as bath
and fancy—a misfortune laid to the accident of his birth; and you will hear
to-day in that flannel-shirted democracy only good concerning this aristocrat
born and bred.</p>
<p>Now, besides several morals which no pious person will find difficult to draw
from the decline and fall of this aristocrat, there is something more germane
to my democratic contemplation: after all, when driven to flock with Texas, he
was a bird of that wild feather. That is the object-lesson; that is the gist of
the matter. Directly the English nobleman smelt Texas, the slumbering untamed
Saxon awoke in him, and mindful of the tournament, mindful of the
hunting-field, galloped howling after wild cattle, a born horseman, a perfect
athlete, and spite of the peerage and gules and argent, fundamentally kin with
the drifting vagabonds who swore and galloped by his side. The man's outcome
typifies the way of his race from the beginning. Hundreds like him have gone to
Australia, Canada, India, and have done likewise, and in our own continent you
may see the thing plainer than anywhere else. No rood of modern ground is more
debased and mongrel with its hordes of encroaching alien vermin, that turn our
cities to Babels and our citizensliip to a hybrid farce, who degrade our
commonwealth from a nation into something half pawn-shop, half broker's
office. But to survive in the clean cattle country requires spirit of
adventure, courage, and self-sufficiency; you will not find many Poles or Huns
or Russian Jews in that district; it stands as yet untainted by the benevolence
of Baron Hirsch. Even in the cattle country the respectable Swedes settle
chiefly to farming, and are seldom horsemen. The community of which the
aristocrat appropriately made one speaks English. The Frenchman to-day is seen
at his best inside a house; he can paint and he can play comedy, but he seldom
climbs a new mountain. The Italian has forgotten Columbus, and sells fruit.
Among the Spaniards and the Portuguese no Cortez or Magellan is found to-day.
Except in Prussia, the Teuton is too often a tame, slippered animal, with his
pedantic mind swaddled in a dressing-gown. But the Anglo-Saxon is still forever
homesick for out-of-doors.</p>
<p>Throughout his career it has been his love to push further into the
wilderness, and his fate thereby to serve larger causes than his own. In
following his native bent he furthers unwittingly a design outside himself; he
cuts the way for the common law and self-government, and new creeds, polities,
and nations arise in his wake; in his own immense commonwealth this planless
rover is obliterated.  Roving took him (the Viking portion of him) from his
Norse crags across to Albion. From that hearth of Albion the footprints of his
sons lead to the corners of the earth; beside that hearth how inveterate
remains his flavor! At Hastings he tasted defeat, but was not vanquished; to
the Invincible Armada he proved a grievous surprise; one way or another he
came through Waterloo—possibly because he is inveterately dull at perceiving
himself beaten; when not otherwise busy at Balaklava or by the Alma, he was
getting up horse-races, ready for sport or killing, and all with that silver
and cut-glass finish which so offends our whistling, vacant-minded democracy.
Greatest triumph and glory of all, because spiritual, his shoulders bore the
Reformation when its own originators had tottered. Away from the hearth the
cut-glass stage will not generally have been attained by him, and in Maine or
Kentucky you can recognize at sight the chip of the old rough block.  But if
you meet him upon his island, in the shape of a peer, and find him particular
to dress for dinner seven days of the week, do not on that account imagine that
his white tie has throttled the man in him. That is a whistling Fourth-of-July
misconception. It's no symptom of patriotism to be unable to see a man through
cut glass, and if it comes to an appraisement of the stranger and the peer, I
should say, put each in the other's place, and let us see if the stranger could
play the peer as completely as the nobleman played the cowboy. Sir Francis
Drake was such a one; and Raleigh, the fine essence of Anglo-Saxon, with his
fashionable gallant cloak, his adventure upon new seas, and his immediate
appreciation of tobacco. The rover may return with looted treasure or
incidentally stolen corners of territory to clap in his strong-box (this Angle
is no angel), but it is not the dollars that played first fiddle with him,
else our Hebrew friends would pioneer the whole of us. Adventure, to be
out-of-doors, to find some new place far away from the postman, to enjoy
independence of spirit or mind or body (according to his high or low
standards)—this is the cardinal surviving fittest instinct that makes the Saxon
through the centuries conqueror, invader, navigator, buccaneer, explorer,
colonist, tigershooter; lifts him a pilgrim among the immortals at Plymouth
Rock, dangles him a pirate from the gallows on the docks of Bristol. At all
times when historic conditions or private stress have burst his domestic crust
and let him fly out naturally, there he is, on Darien's peak, or through
Magellan, or across the Missouri, or up the Columbia, a Hawkins, a Boone, a
Grey, or a nameless vagrant, the same Saxon, ploughing the seas and carving the
forests in every shape of man, from preacher to thief, and in each shape
changelessly untamed. And as he has ruled the waves with his ship from that
Viking time until yesterday at Samoa, when approaching death could extract no
sound from him save American cheers and music, so upon land has the horse been
his foster-brother, his ally, his playfellow, from the tournament at Camelot to
the round-up at Abilene. The blood and the sweat of his jousting, and all the
dirt and stains, have faded in the long sunlight of tradition, and in the
chronicles of romance we hear none of his curses or obscenity; the clash of his
armor rings mellow and heroic down the ages into our modern ears. But his
direct lineal offspring among our Western mountains has had no poet to connect
him with the eternal, no distance to lend him enchantment; though he has fought
single-handed with savages, and through skill and daring prevailed, though he
has made his nightly bed in a thousand miles of snow and loneliness, he has
not, and never will have, the &quot;consecration of memory.&quot; No doubt Sir Launcelot
bore himself with a grace and breeding of which our unpolished fellow of the
cattle trail has only the latent possibility; but in personal daring and in
skill as to the horse, the knight and the cowboy are nothing but the same Saxon
of different environments, the nobleman in London and the nobleman in Texas;
and no hoof in Sir Thomas Mallory shakes the crumbling plains with quadruped
sound more valiant than the galloping that has echoed from the Rio Grande to
the Big Horn Mountains. But we have no Sir Thomas Malloryi! Since Hawthorne,
Longfellow, and Cooper were taken from us, our flippant and impoverished
imagination has ceased to be national, and the rider among Indians and cattle,
the frontiersman, the American who replaces Miles Standish and the Pathfinder,
is now beneath the notice of polite writers.</p>
<p>From the tournament to the round-up!  Deprive the Saxon of his horse, and put
him to forest-clearing or in a countinghouse for a couple of generations, and
you may pass him by without ever seeing that his legs are designed for the
gripping of saddles. Our first hundred years afforded his horsemanship but
little opportunity. Though his out-of-door spirit, most at home when at large,
sported free in the elbow-room granted by the surrender of Cornwallis, it was
on foot and with an axe that he chiefly enjoyed himself. He moved his log cabin
slowly inward from the Atlantic, slowly over the wooded knolls of Cumberland
and Allegheny, down and across the valley beyond, until the infrequent news of
him ceased, and his kinsfolk who had staid by the sea, and were merchanting
themselves upwards to the level of family portraits and the cutglass finish,
forgot that the prodigal in the backwoods belonged to them, and was part of
their United States, bone of their bone.  And thus did our wide country become
as a man whose East hand knoweth not what his West hand doeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Herndon, in telling of Lincoln's early days in Illinois, gives us a
complete picture of the roving Saxon upon our continent in 1830. &quot;The boys...
were a terror to the entire region—seemingly a necessary product of frontier
civilization. They were friendly and good-natured... They would do almost
anything for sport or fun, love or necessity. Though rude and rough, though
life's forces ran over the edge of their bowl, foaming and sparkling in pure
deviltry for deviltry's sake,... yet place before them a poor man who needed
their aid, ... a defenceless woman,...  they melted into sympathy and charity
at once. They gave all they had, and willingly toiled or played cards for
more...  A stranger's introduction was likely to be the most unpleasant part of
his acquaintance... They were in the habit of 'cleaning out' New Salem.&quot;
Friendly and goodnatured, and in the habit of cleaning out New Salem!  Quite
so. There you have him. Here is the American variety of the Saxon set down for
you as accurately as if Audubon himself had done it. A colored plate of Robin
Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham should go on the opposite page.  Nothing but
the horse is left out of the description, and that is because the Saxon and his
horse seldom met during the rail-splitting era of our growth.  But the man of
1830 would give away all that he had and play cards for more.  Decidedly
nothing was missing except the horse—and the horse was waiting in another part
of our large map until the man should arrive and jump on his back again.</p>
<p>A few words about this horse — the horse of the plains. Whether or no his
forefathers looked on when Montezuma fell, they certainly hailed from Spain.
And whether it was missionaries or thieves who carried them northward from
Mexico, until the Sioux heard of the new animal, certain it also is that this
pony ran wild for a century or two, either alone or with various red-skinned
owners; and as he gathered the sundry experiences of war and peace, of being
stolen, and of being abandoned in the snow at inconvenient distances from home,
of being ridden by two women and a baby at once, and of being eaten by a bear,
his wide range of contretemps brought him a wit sharper than the street Arab's,
and an attitude towards life more blase than in the united capitals of Europe.
I have frequently caught him watching me with an eye of such sardonic
depreciation that I felt it quite vain to attempt any hiding from him of my
incompetence; and as for surprising him, a locomotive cannot do it, for I have
tried this. He relishes putting a man in absurd positions, and will wait many
days in patience to compass this uncharitable thing; and when he cannot bring
a man to derision, he contents himself with a steer or a buffalo, helping the
man to rope and throw these animals with an ingenuity surpassing any circus, to
my thinking. A number of delighted passengers on the Kansas Pacific Railway
passed by a Mexican vaquero, who had been sent out from Kansas City to rope a
buffalo as an advertisement for the stock-yards. The train stopped to take a
look at the solitary horseman fast to a buffalo in the midst of the plains.
Jose, who had his bull safely roped, shouted to ask if they had water on the
train.  &quot;We'll bring you some,&quot; said they. &quot;Oh, I come get,&quot; said he; and
jumping off, he left his accomplished pony in sole charge of the buffalo.
Whenever the huge beast struggled for freedom, the clever pony stiffened his
legs and leaned back as in a tug of war, by jumps and dodges so anticipating
each move of the enemy that escape was entirely hopeless. The boy got his
drink, and his employer sent out a car for the buffalo, which was taken in
triumph into Kansas City behind the passenger train.  The Mexican narrated the
exploit to his employer thus: &quot;Oh, Shirley, when the train start they all give
three greata big cheers for me, and then they give three mucha bigger cheers
for the little gray boss!&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, progress is truly a wonder! and admirable beyond all doubt it is to behold
the rapid new square miles of brick, and the stream rich with the contributions
of an increased population, and tall factories that have stopped dividends just
for the present, and long empty railroads in the hands of the receiver; but I
prefer that unenlightened day when we had plenty of money and cheered for the
little gray boss. Such was the animal that awaited the coming of the
rail-splitter. The meeting was a long way off in 1830. Not the Mexican war, not
the gold on the Pacific in '49 (though this, except for the horse, revealed the
whole Saxon at his best and worst, and for a brief and beautiful moment waked
once more the American muse), not any national event until the war of the
rebellion was over and we had a railroad from coast to coast, brought the man
and his horse together. It was in the late sixties that this happened in Texas.
The adventurous sons of Kentucky and Tennessee, forever following the native
bent to roam, and having no longer a war to give them the life they preferred,
came into a new country full of grass and cattle. Here they found Mexicans by
the hundred, all on horses and at large over the flat of the world.  This sight
must have stirred memories in the rail-splitter's blood, for he joined the
sport upon the instant. I do not think he rode with bolder skill than the
Mexican's, but he brought other and grittier qualities to bear upon that wild
life, and also the Saxon contempt for the foreigner. Soon he had taken what was
good from this small, deceitful alien, including his name, Vaquero, which he
translated into Cowboy. Ho took his saddle, his bridle, his spurs, his rope,
his methods of branding and herding — indeed, most of his customs and
accoutrements—and with them he went rioting over the hills. His playground was
two thousand miles long and a thousand wide. The hoofs of his horse were tough
as iron, and the pony waged the joyous battle of self-preservation as stoutly
as did his rider. When the man lay rolled in his blankets sleeping, warm and
unconcerned beneath a driving storm of snow, the beast pawed through to the
sage-brush and subsisted; so that it came to be said of such an animal, &quot;A meal
a day is enough for a man who gets to ride that horse.&quot;</p>
<p>The cow-puncher's play-ground in those first glorious days of his prosperity
included battle and murder and sudden death as every-day matters. From 1865 to
1878 in Texas he fought his way with knife and gun, and any hour of the
twenty-four might see him flattened behind the rocks among the whiz of bullets
and the flight of arrows, or dragged bloody and folded together from some adobe
hovel. Seventy-five dollars a month and absolute health and strength were his
wages; and when the news of all this excellence drifted from Texas eastward,
they came in shoals—Saxon boys of picked courage (none but plucky ones could
survive) from South and North, from town and country. Every sort and degree of
home tradition came with them from their far birthplaces. Some had known the
evening hymn at one time, others could remember no parent or teacher earlier
than the street; some spoke with the gentle accent of Virginia, others in the
dialect of baked beans and codfish; here and there was the baccalaureate,
already beginning to forget his Greek alphabet, but still able to repeat the
two notable words with which Xenophon always marches upon the next stage of
his journey. Hither to the cattle country they flocked from forty kinds of
home, each bringing a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>What motlier tribe, what heap of cards shuffled from more various unmatched
packs, could be found? Yet this tribe did not remain motley, but soon grew into
a unit. To begin with, the old spirit burned alike in all, the unextinguished
fire of adventure and independence. And then, the same stress of shifting for
self, the same vigorous and peculiar habits of life, were forced upon each one:
watching for Indians, guarding huge herds at night, chasing cattle, wild as
deer, over rocks and counties, sleeping in the dust and waking in the snow,
cooking in the open, swimming the swollen rivers. Such gymnasium for mind and
body develops a like pattern in the unlike. Thus, late in the nineteenth
century, was the race once again subjected to battles and darkness, rain and
shine, to the fierceness and generosity of the desert. Destiny tried her latest
experiment upon the Saxon, and plucking him from the library, the haystack, and
the gutter, set him upon his horse; then it was that, face to face with the
eternal simplicity of death, his modern guise fell away and showed once again
the mediseval man. It was no new type, no product of the frontier, but just the
original kernel of the nut with the shell broken.</p>
<p>This bottom bond of race unified the diverse young men, who came riding from
various points of the compass, speaking university and gutter English
simultaneously; and as the knights of Camelot prized their armor and were
particular about their swords, so these dusty successors had an extreme pride
of equipment and put aside their jeans and New York suits for the tribal
dress. Though each particle of gearing for man and horse was evoked from daily
necessity, gold and silver instantly stepped in to play their customary
ornamental part, as with all primitive races. The cow-puncher's legs must be
fended from the thorny miles of the Rio Grande, the thousand mongrel shrubs
that lace their bristles together stiff over the country—the mesquite, the
shin-oak, the catsclaw, the Spanish-dagger; widespreading, from six inches to
ten feet high, every vegetable vicious with an embroidery of teeth and nails;
a continent of peevish thicket called chaparral, as we indiscriminately call a
dog with too many sorts of grandfathers a cur.  Into this saw-mill dives the
wild steer through paths and passages known to himself, and after him the
pursuing man must also dive at a rate that would tear his flesh to ribbons if
the blades and points could get hold of him. But he cases his leg against the
hostile chaparral from thigh to ankle in chaps—leathern breeches, next door to
armor: his daily bread is scarcely more needful to him. Soon his barbaric
pleasure in finery sews tough leather fringe along their sides, and the leather
flap of the pocket becomes stamped with a heavy rose. Sagging in a slant upon
his hips leans his leather belt of cartridges buckled with jaunty arrogance,
and though he uses his pistol with murderous skill, it is pretty, with ivory or
mother-of-pearl for a handle. His arm must be loose to swing his looped rope
free and drop its noose over the neck of the animal that bounds in front of his
rushing pony. Therefore he rides in a loose flannel shirt that will not cramp
him as he whirls the coils; but the handkerchief knotted at his throat, though
it is there to prevent sunburn, will in time of prosperity be chosen for its
color and soft texture, a scarf to draw the eye of woman. His heavy splendid
saddle is, in its shape and luxury of straps and leather thongs, the completest
instrument for night and day travel, and the freighting along with you of board
and lodging, that any nomad has so far devised. With its trappings and stamped
leather, its horn and high cantle, we are well acquainted.  It must stand the
strain of eight hundred sudden pounds of live beef tearing at it for freedom;
it must be the anchor that shall not drag during the furious rages of such a
typhoon. For the cattle of the wilderness have often run wild for three, four.
and five years, through rocks and forests, never seeing the face of man from
the day when as little calves they were branded. And some were never branded at
all.  They have grown up in company with the deer, and like the deer they fly
at the approach of the horseman. Then, if he has ridden out to gather these
waifs from their remote untenanted pastures and bring them in to be counted and
driven to sale, he must abandon himself to the headlong pursuit. The open easy
plain with its harmless footing lies behind, the steep valley narrows up to an
entering wedge among the rocks, and into these untoward regions rush the
beeves. The shale and detritus of shelving landslides, the slippery knobs in
the beds of brooks, the uncertain edges of the jumping-off place, all lie in
the road of the day's necessity, and where the steer goes, goes the cow-puncher
too—balancing, swaying, doubling upon his shrewd pony. The noose uncoiling
flies swinging through the air and closes round the throat—or perhaps only the
liind leg—of the quarry.  In the shock of stopping short or of leaning to
circle, the rider's stirrups must be long, and his seat a forked pliant poise
on the horse's back; no grip of the knee will answer in these contortions; his
leg must have its straight length, a lever of muscle and sinew to yield or
close viselike on the pony's ribs; and when the steer feels that he is taken
and the rope tightens from the saddle horn, then must the gearing be solid,
else, like a fisherman floundering with snapped rod and tangled line, the
cow-puncher will have misfortunes to repair and nothing to repair them with.
Such a thing as this has happened in New Mexico: The steer, pursued and frantic
at feeling the throttle of the flung rope, ran blindly over a cliff, one end of
the line fast to him, the other to the rider's saddle horn, and no time to
think once, much less twice, about anything in this or the next world. The pony
braced his legs at the edge, but his gait swept him onward, as with the fast
skater whose skate has stuck upon a frozen chip. The horse fell over the
mountain, and with him his rider; but the sixty-foot rope was new, and it
hooked over a stump. Steer and horse swung like scales gently above the man,
who lay at the bottom, hurt nearly to death, but not enough to dull his
appreciation of the unusual arrangement.</p>
<p>It is well, then, to wear leathern armor and sit in a stout saddle if you would
thrive among the thorns and rocks; and without any such casualty as falling
over a mountain, the day's common events call for uncommon strength of gear.
Not otherwise can the steer be hooked and landed safely, and not otherwise is
the man to hoist resisting beeves up a hill somewhat as safes are conducted to
the sixth story, nor could the rider plunge galloping from the sixth story to
the ground, or swerve and heavily lean to keep from flying into space, were his
stirrup leathers not laced, and every other crucial spot of strain independent
of so weak a thing as a buckle. To go up where you have come down is another
and easier process for man and straps and everything except the horse. His
breath and legs are not immortal. And in order that each day the man may be
hardily borne over rough and smooth he must own several mounts—a &quot;string&quot; ;
sometimes six and more, either his own property, or allotted to him by the
foreman of the outfit for which he rides. The unused animals run in a herd—the
ramuda; and to get a fresh mount from the ramuda means not seldom the ceremony
of catching your hare. The ponies walk sedately together in the pasture, good
as gold, and eying you without concern until they perceive that you are come
with an object. They then put forth against you all the circus knowledge you
have bestowed upon them so painfully.  They comprehend ropes and loops and the
law of gravity; they have observed the errors of steers in similar cases, and
the unattractive result of running inside any enclosure, such as a corral, they
strategize to keep at large, and altogether chasing a steer is tortoise play to
the game they can set up for you. They relish the sight of you whirling
impotent among them, rejoice in the smoking pace and the doublings they
perpetrate; and with one eye attentive to you and your poised rope, and the
other dexterously commanding the universe, they will intertangle as in
cross-tag, pushing between your design and its victim, mingling confusedly like
a driven mist, and all this with nostrils leaning level to the wind and
bellies close to the speeding ground.  But when the desired one is at last
taken and your successful rope is on his neck, vou would not dream he had ever
wished for anything else. He stands, submitting absent-mindedly to bit and
blanket, mild as any unconscious lamb, while placidity descends once more upon
the herd; again they pasture good as gold, and butter would not melt in the
mouth of one of these conscientious creatures. I have known a number of dogs,
one crow, and two monkeys, but these combined have seemed to me less fertile in
expedient than the cow-pony, the sardonic cayuse. The bit his master gave him,
and the bridle and spurs, have the same origin from necessity and the same
history as to ornament. If stopping and starting and turning must be like
flashes of light, the apparatus is accordingly severe; and as for the spurs,
those wheels with long spikes cease to seem grotesque whpn you learn that with
shorter and sharper rowels they would catch in the corded meshes of the girth,
and bring the rider to ruin. Silver and gold, when he could pay for them, went
into the make and decoration of this smaller machinery; and his hat would cost
him fifteen dollars, and he wore fringed gloves. His boots often cost
twenty-five dollars in his brief hour of opulence. Come to town for his
holiday, he wore his careful finery, and from his wide hat-brim to his
jingling heels made something of a figure — as self-conscious and deliberate a
show as any painted buck in council or bull-elk among his aspiring cows; and
out of town in the mountains, as wild and lean and dangerous as buck or bull
knows how to be.</p>
<p>As with his get-up, so it went with his vocabulary; for any manner of life
with a rule and flavor of its own strong enough to put a new kind of dress on a
man's body will put new speech in his mouth, and an idiom derived from the
exigencies of his days and nights was soon spoken by the cow-puncher. Like all
creators, he not only built, but borrowed his own wherever he found it.  Chaps,
from chapparajos, is only one of many transfers from the Mexican, one out of (I
should suppose) several hundred ; and in lover-wolf is a singular instance of
half-baked translation. Lobo, pronounced lovo, being the Spanish for wolf, and
the coyote being a sort of wolf, the dialect of the southern border has slid
into this name for a wolf that is larger, and a worse enemy to steers than the
small coward coyote. Lover-wolf is a word anchored to its district. In the
Northwest, though the same animal roams there as dangerously, his Texas name
would be as unknown as the Northwest's word for Indian, siwash, from sauvage,
would be along the Rio Grande. Thus at the top and bottom of our map do French
and Spanish trickle across the frontier, and with English melt into two
separate amalgams which are wholly distinct, and which remain near the spot
where they were moulded; while other compounds, having the same Northern and
Southern starting-point, drift far and wide, and become established in the
cowpuncher's dialect over his whole country.  No better French specimen can be
instanced than cache, verb and noun, from the verb cacher, to conceal. In our
Eastern life words such as these are of no pertinent avail; and as it is only
universal pertinence which can lift a fragment of dialect into the dictionary's
good society, most of them must pass with the transient generation that spoke
them. Certain ones there are deserving to survive ; cinch, for instance, from
cincha, the Mexican girth. From its narrow office under the horse's belly it
has come to perform in metaphor a hundred services.  In cinching somebody or
something you may mean that you hold four aces, or the key of a political
crisis; and when a man is very much indeed upper-dog, then he is said to have
an air-tight cinch; and this phrase is to me so pleasantly eloquent that I am
withheld from using it in polite gatherings only by that prudery which we carry
as a burden along with the benefits of academic training. Besides the foreign
importations, such as arroyo and riata, that stand unchanged, and those others
which under the action of our own speech have sloughed their native shape and
come out something new, like quirt—once cuerta, Mexican for rawhide—is the
third large class of words which the cowboy has taken from our sober old
dictionary stock and made over for himself. Pie-biter refers not to those
hailing from our pie belt, but to a cowpony who secretly forages in a camp
kitchen to indulge his acquired tastes.  Western whiskey, besides being known
as tonsil varnish and a hundred different things, goes as benzine, not
unjustly.  The same knack of imagery that upon our Eastern slope gave visitors
from the country the brief, sure name of hayseed, calls their Western
equivalents junipers.</p>
<p>Hay grows scant upon the Rocky Mountains, but those seclusions are filled with
evergreens. No one has accounted to me for hobo. A hobo is a wandering
unemployed person, a stealer of rides on freighttrains, a diner at the back
door, eternally seeking honest work, and when brought face to face with it
eternally retreating.  The hobo is he against whom we have all sinned by
earning our living. Perhaps some cowboy saw an Italian playing a pipe to the
accompaniment of the harp, and made the generalization: oboe may have given us
hobo. Hobo-ken has been suggested by an ingenious friend; but the word seems of
purely Western origin, and I heard it in the West several years before it
became used in the East. The cow-puncher's talent for making a useful verb out
of anything shows his individuality. Any young strong race will always lay firm
hands on language and squeeze juice from it; and you instantly comprehend the
man who tells you of his acquaintances, whom you know to be drunk at the
moment, that they are <em>helling</em> around town. Unsleeping need for quick thinking
and doing gave these nomads the pith of utterance. They say, for instance, that
they intend <em>camping on a mail's trail</em>, meaning, concisely, &quot;So-and-so has
injured us, and we are going to follow him day and night until we are quits.&quot;
Thus do these ordinary words and phrases, freshened to novelty by the
cow-puncher's wits, show his unpremeditated art of brevity, varying in aptness,
but in imagination constant; and with one last example of his fancy I shall
leave his craft of word-making.</p>
<p>It is to be noted in all peoples that for whatever particular thing in life is
of frequent and familiar practice among them they will devise many gradations
of epithet. <em>To go</em> is in the cattle country a common act, and a man may go for
different reasons, in several manners, at various speeds. For example:</p>
<p>&quot;Do I understand you went up the tree with the bear just behind you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The bear was not in front of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the cowboy made ordinary words suffice for showing the way he went, but
his goings can be of many sorts besides in front of and behind something, and
his rich choice of synonyms embodies a latent chapter of life and habits. To
the several phases of going known to the pioneer as vamose, skip, light out,
dust, and git, the cowboy adds, burn the earth, hit, hit the breeze, pull your
freight, jog, amble, move, pack, rattle your hocks, brindle, and more, very
likely, if I knew or could recall them; I think that the observer who caught
the shifting flicker of a race or a pursuit, and said brindle first, had a mind
of liveliness and art.</p>
<p>It may be that some of these words I have named as home-bred natives of our
wilderness are really of long standing and archaic repute, and that the scholar
can point to them in the sonnets of Shakespeare, but I, at least, first learned
them west of the Missouri.  With a speech and dress of his own, then, the
cow-puncher drove his herds to Abilene or Westport Landing in the Texas times,
and the easy abundant dollars came, and left him for spurs and bridles of
barbaric decoration. Let it be remembered that the Mexican was the original
cowboy, and that the American improved on him. Those were the days in which he
was long in advance of settlers, and when he literally fought his right of way.
Along the waste hundreds of miles that he had to journey, three sorts of
inveterate enemies infested the road—the thief (the cattle-thief, I mean), who
was as daring as himself; the supplanted Mexican, who hated the new encroaching
Northern race; and the Indian, whose hand was against all races but his own
immediate tribe, and who flayed the feet of his captives, and made them walk so
through the mountain passes to the fires in which he slowly burned them.  Among
these perils the cow-puncher took wild pleasure in existing. No soldier of
fortune ever adventured with bolder carelessness, no fiercer blood ever stained
a border. If his raids, his triumphs, and his reverses have inspired no
minstrel to sing of him who rode by the Pecos River and the hills of San
Andreas, it is not so much the Rob Roy as the Walter Scott who is lacking. And
the Flora Mclvor! Alas! the stability of the clan, the blessing of the home
background, was not there. These wild men sprang from the loins of no similar
father, and begot no sons to continue their hardihood. War they made in
plenty, but not love; for the woman they saw was not the woman a man can take
into his heart. That their fighting Saxon ancestors awoke in them for a moment
and made them figures for poetry and ro mance is due to the strange accidents
of a young country, where, while cities flourish by the coast and in the
direct paths of trade, the herd-trading interior remains mediaeval in its
simplicity and violence. And yet this transient generation deserves more
chronicling than it will ever have. Deeds in plenty were done that are all and
more than imagination should require. One high noon upon the plains by the Rio
Grande the long irons lay hot in the fire. The young cattle vrere being
branded, and the gathered herd covered the plain. Two owners claimed one
animal. They talked at first quietly round the fire, then the dispute
quickened. One roped the animal, throwing it to the ground to burn his mark
upon it. A third came, saying the steer was his. The friends of each drew
close to hear, and a claimant thrust his redhot iron against the hide of the
animal tied on the ground. Another seized it from him, and as they fell
struggling, their adherents flung themselves upon their horses, and massing
into clans, volleyed with their guns across the fire. In a few minutes fourteen
riders lay dead on the plain, and the tied animal over which they had
quarrelled bawled and bleated in the silence. Here is skirmishing enough for a
ballad. And there was a certain tireless man in northern New Mexico whose war
upon cattle-thieves made his life so shining a mark that he had in bank five
thousand dollars to go to the man who killed the man who killed him. A
neighborhood where one looks so far beyond his own assassination as to provide
a competence for his avenger is discouraging to family life, but a promising
field for literature.</p>
<p>Such existence soon makes a strange man of any one, and the early cowpunchers
rapidly grew unlike all people but each other and the wild superstitious
ancestors whose blood was in their veins.  Their hair became long, and their
glance rested with serene penetration upon the stranger; they laughed seldom,
and their spirit was in the permanent attitude of war. Grim lean men of few
topics, and not many words concerning these; comprehending no middle between
the poles of brutality and tenderness; indifferent to death, but disconcerted
by a good woman; some with violent Old Testament religion, some avowing none,
and all of them uneasy about corpses and the dark. These hermited horsemen
would dismount in camp at nightfall and lie looking at the stars, or else squat
about the fire conversing with crude sombreness of brands and horses and cows,
speaking of humans when they referred to men.</p>
<p>To-day they are still to be found in New Mexico, their last domain. The extreme
barrenness of those mountains has held tamer people at a distance. That next
stage of Western progress—that unparalleled compound of new hotels, electric
lights, and invincible ignorance which has given us the Populist—has been
retarded, and the civilization of Colorado and silver does not yet redeem New
Mexico. But in these shrunk days the cow-puncher no longer can earn money to
spend on ornament; he dresses poorly and wears his chaps very wide and
ungainly. But he still has three mounts, with seven horses to each mount, and
his life is in the saddle among vast solitudes. In the North he was a later
comer, and never quite so formidable a person. By the time he had ridden up
into Wyoming and Montana the Indian was mostly gone, the locomotive upon the
scene, and going West far less an exploration than in the Texas days. Into
these new pastures drifted youths from town and country whose grit would
scarcely have lasted them to Abilene, and who were not the grim longhaired
type, but a sort of glorified farm hand. They too wore their pistols, and rode
gallantly, and out of them nature and simplicity did undoubtedly forge manlier,
cleaner men than what our streets breed of no worse material. They galloped by
the side of the older hands, and caught something of the swing and tradition of
the first years. They developed heartiness and honesty in virtue and in vice
alike. Their evil deeds were not of the sneaking kind, but had always the
saving grace of courage. Their code had no place for the man who steals a
pocket-book or stabs in the back.</p>
<p>And what has become of them? Where is this latest outcropping of the Saxon
gone? Except where he lingers in the mountains of New Mexico he has been
dispersed, as the elk, as the buffalo, as all wild animals must inevitably be
dispersed.  Three things swept him away—the exhausting of the virgin pastures,
the coming of the wire fence, and Mr. Armour of Chicago, who set the price of
beef to suit himself. But all this may be summed up ill the word Progress. When
the bankrupt cow-puncher felt Progress dispersing him, he seized whatever plank
floated nearest him in the wreck. He went to town for a job; he got a position
on the railroad; he set up a saloon; he married, and fenced in a little farm
; and he turned &quot;rustler,&quot; and stole the cattle from the men for whom he had
once worked. In these capacities will you find him to-day. The ex-cowboy who
set himself to some new way of wage-earning is all over the West, and his old
courage and frankness still stick to him, but his peculiar independence is of
necessity dimmed. The only man who has retained that wholly is the outlaw, the
horse and cattle thief, on whose grim face hostility to Progress forever sits.
He has had a checkered career. He has been often hanged, often shot; he is
generally &quot;wanted&quot; in several widely scattered districts. I know one who used
to play the banjo to me on Powder River as he swung his long boots over the
side of his bunk. I have never listened to any man's talk with more interest
and diversion. Once he has been to Paris on the proceeds of a lengthy
well-conducted theft; once he has been in prison for murder. He has the bluest
eye, the longest nose, and the coldest face I ever saw. This stripe of
gentleman still lives and thrives through the cattle country, occasionally
goes out into the waste of land in the most delicate way, and presently cows
and steers are missed. But he has driven them many miles to avoid live-stock
inspectors, and it may be that if you know him by sight and happen to be in a
town where cattle are bought, such as Kansas City, you will meet him at the
best hotel there, full of geniality and affluence.</p>
<p>Such is the story of the cow-puncher, the American descendant of Saxon
ancestors, who for thirty years flourished upon our part of the earth, and,
because he was not compatible with Progress, is now departed, never to return.
But because Progress has just now given us the Populist and silver in exchange
for him, is no ground for lament. He has never made a good citizen, but only a
good soldier, from his tournament days down.  And if our nation in its growth
have no worse distemper than the Populist to weather through, there is hope
for us, even though present signs disincline us to make much noise upon the
Fourth of July.</p>
