<H1>Why LD_LIBRARY_PATH is bad</H1>

By <a href="http://www.visi.com/~barr/">David Barr, barr@visi.com</a>

<p>Copied from Internet Archive, https://web.archive.org/web/20060713225354id_/http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html

<H2>Background</H2>
This is one system administrator's point of view why LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
as frequently used, is bad.  This is written from a SunOS 4.x/5.x (and to
some extent Linux) point of view, but this also applies to most other
UNIXes.<P>

<H2>What LD_LIBRARY_PATH does</H2>

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable you set to give the run-time
shared library loader (ld.so) an extra set of directories to look for
when searching for shared libraries.  Multiple directories can be listed,
separated with a colon (:).  This list is <em>prepended</em> to the
existing list of compiled-in loader paths for a given executable, and
any system default loader paths.<p>

For security reasons, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored at runtime for
executables that have their setuid or setgid bit set.  This
severely limits the usefulness of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

<H2>Why was it invented?</H2>

There were a couple good reasons why it was invented:

<ul>
<li>To test out new library routines against an already compiled
binary (for either backward compatibility or for new feature testing).
<li>To have a short term way out in case you wanted to move a set of
shared libraries to another location.
</ul>

As an often unwanted side effect, LD_LIBRARY_PATH will also be searched
at link (ld) stage after directories specified with <tt>-L</tt> (also if
no <tt>-L</tt> flag is given).

Some good examples of how LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used:
<ul>
<li>When upgrading shared libraries, you can test out a library before
replacing it.
<li>In a similar vein, in case your upgrade program depends on shared
libraries and may freak out if you replace a shared library out from under
it, you can use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to a directory with copy of a 
shared libraries and then you can replace the system copy without
worry.  You can even undo things should things fail by moving the copy
back.
<li>X11 uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH during its build process.  X11 distributes its
fonts in "bdf" format, and during the build process it needs to "compile"
the bdf files into "pcf" files.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used to point the the
build lib directory
so it can run bdftopcf during the build stage before the shared libraries
are installed.
<li>Perl can be installed with most of its core code as a shared library.
This is handy if you embed Perl in other programs -- you can compile them
so they use the shared library and so you'll save memory at run time.
However Perl uses Perl scripts at various points in the build and install
process.  The 'perl' binary won't run until its shared libraries are
installed, unless LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used to bootstrap the process.
</ul>

<H2>How has it been corrupted?</H2>

Too often people use it as a crutch for not doing the right thing
(i.e. relying on the compiled in path).  Often programs (even commercial
ones) are compiled without any run-time loader paths at all, <em>forcing</em>
you to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set or else the program won't run.<p>

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is one of those insidious things that once it gets
set globally for a user, things tend to happen which cause people to
rely on it being set.  Eventually when LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be
changed or removed, mass breakage will occur!<p>

<H2>How does the shared loader work?</H2>

SunOS 4.x uses major and minor revision numbers.  If you have a
library <tt>Xt</tt>, then it's named something like <tt>libXt.so.4.10</tt>
(Major version
4, minor 10).  If you update the library (to correct a bug, for example),
you would install libX11.so.4.11 and applications would automatically
use the new version.  To do this, the loader must do a readdir() for every
directory in the loader path and glob out the correct file name.  This
is quite expensive especially if the directories are large, contain
symlinks, and/or are located over NFS.<p>

Linux, SunOS 5.x and most other SYSV variants use only major revision
numbers.  A library <tt>Xt</tt> is just named something like
<tt>libXt.so.4</tt>.  (Linux confuses things by generally using
major/minor library file names, but always include a symlink that is
the actual library path referenced.  So, for example, a library
"libXt.so.6" is actually a symlink to "libXt.so.6.0".  The linker/loader
actually looks for "libXt.so.6".)<p>

The loader works essentially the same except that you don't have minor
library updates (you update the existing library) and the loader just
does a stat() for each directory in the loader path.  (This is much
faster)<p>

<H2>The bad old days before separate run-time vs link-time paths</H2>

Nowadays you specify the run-time path for an executable at link stage
with the <tt>-R</tt> (or sometimes <tt>-rpath</tt>) flag to
<tt>ld</tt>.  There's also LD_RUN_PATH which is an environment
variable which acts to <tt>ld</tt> just like specifying
<tt>-R</tt>.<p>

Before all this you had only <tt>-L</tt>, which applied not only
during compile-time, but during run time as well.  There was no way to
say "use this directory during compile time" but "use this other
directory at run time".  There were some rather spectacular failure
modes that one could get in to because of this.  For example, say you
are building X11R6 in an NFS automounted directory
<tt>/home/snoopy/src</tt>.  X11R6 is made up of shared libraries as
well as programs.  The programs are compiled against the libraries when
they are located in the build tree, not in their final installed
location.  Since the linker must resolve symbols at link time, you need
a <tt>-L</tt> path that includes the link-time path <em>in addition
to</em> the final run-time path of, say,
<tt>/usr/local/X11R6/lib</tt>.  Now all the programs which use
shared libraries will look <em>first</em> in
<tt>/home/snoopy/src</tt> for their libraries and then in the
correct place.  Now every time an X11R6 app starts up it NFS automounts
its build directory!  You probably removed the temporary build
directory ages ago, but the linker will still search there.  What's
worse, say snoopy is down or no longer exists, no X11R6 apps will run!
Bummer!  Happily this all has been fixed, assuming your OS has a modern
linker/loader.  It also is worked around by specifying the final run time
path first, before the build path in the <tt>-L</tt> options.<p>

<H3>Evil Case Study #1</H3>

My first experience with this breakage was under SunOS 4.x, with OpenWindows.
For some dumb reason, a few Sun OpenWindows apps were not compiled with
correct run-time loader paths, forcing you to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set all
the time.  Remember, at this time, in the
global OpenWindows startup scripts the system would automatically set
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be <tt>$OPENWINHOME/lib</tt>.<p>

Okay, how did it break?  Well, it just so happens that this site also
had compiled X11R4 from source, in /usr/local/X11R4 .  Things got
really confusing because if you ever wanted to run the X11R4 apps, they
would run against the OpenWindows libraries in
<tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt>, not the libraries in
<tt>/usr/local/X11R4/lib</tt>!  Things got even more confusing once
X11R5 and then X11R6 came out.  Now we had four different and often
incompatible versions of a given shared library.<p>

Hm.  What do you do?  If you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to put OpenWindows
first, then at best it will slow things down (since most people were
running X11R5 and X11R6 stuff, searching for libraries in 
<tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt> was a waste).  At worst it caused
spurious warnings ("ld.so: warning: libX11.x.y has older revision than
expected z") or caused apps to break altogether due to incompatibilities.
It was also confusing to lots of people trying to compile X apps and
forget to use <tt>-L</tt>.

What did I do?  I whipped out emacs and binary edited the few OpenWindows
apps which didn't have a correct run-time path compiled in, and changed
to the correct location in /usr/openwin/lib.  (it should be noted that
these tended to be apps which were fixed with system patches.. alas
it seems guys who build the patched versions didn't have the same
environment as the FCS guys).  I then changed all the startup scripts
and removed any "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH" statements.  I even put in
an "unsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in my own .cshrc for good measure.

<H3>Evil Case Study #2</H3>

(based on a true story).<P>

Due to licensing issues, it's common for commercial apps to ship
in binary form a copy of the shared Motif library.  Motif is a commercial
product, and not all OS's come with it.  It's a common toolkit
for commercial programs to write applications against.  It's also
an evolving product, with ongoing bugfixes and new features.<p>

Say application WidgetMan is one such application.  In its startup script,
it sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to its copy of Motif so it uses that
one when it runs.  As it happens, WidgetMan is designed to launch
other programs too.  Unfortunately, when WidgetMan launches other apps,
they inherit the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting and some Motif based apps
now break when run from WidgetMan because WidgetMan's Motif is incompatible
with (but the same library version as) the system Motif library.  Bummer!<p>

Imagine if you had followed what some clueless commercial install apps
tell you to do and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH <em>globally</em>!<p>

<H2>Half-hearted attempts to improve things</H2>

Some OS's (e.g. Linux) have a configurable loader.  You can
configure what run-time paths to look in by modifying
<tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>.  This is almost as bad a LD_LIBRARY_PATH!
Install scripts should <em>never</em> modify this file!  This file
should contain only the standard library locations as shipped with the OS.

<H1>Canonical rules for handling LD_LIBRARY_PATH</H1>

<ol>
<li>Never <em>ever</em> set LD_LIBRARY_PATH globally.<p>

<li>If you must ship binaries that use shared libraries and want to allow
your clients to install the program outside a 'standard' location, do
one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Ship your binaries as .o files, and as part of the install process
relink them with the correct installation library path.
<li>Ship executables with a very long "dummy" run-time library path, and
as part of the install process use a binary editor to substitute
the correct install library path in the executable.
</ul>
<li>If you are forced to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, do so <em>only</em> as part of
a wrapper.<p>
</ol>

Some software packages make you install a symlink from the standard location
pointing to the real location.  While this 'works', it does not solve
the problem.  What if you need to have two versions installed?  Not
to mention the fact that many vendors seem to choose stupid locations
as their 'standard' location (like putting them in '/' or '/usr').  This
also typically makes things difficult for network installations, since
even though you install an application on a network directory, you need
to go around to every computer on the network and make a symlink.

<H1>Thoughts on improving LD_LIBRARY_PATH implementations in UNIX</H1>

<ul>
<li>Remove the link-time aspect of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  (Solaris's <tt>ld</tt>
will do this with the <tt>-i</tt> flag).  Too often people
just lazily set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so they don't have to specify <tt>-L</tt>,
causing bad consequences at run time for other apps.  Or on the flip side
people will set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to fix some brokenness at run time with
some app, but it will lead to confusion or breakage at compile time for
some other app if they don't specify a correct <tt>-L</tt> path.  It
would be much cleaner if LD_LIBRARY_PATH only had influence at run-time.
If necessary, invent some other environment variable for the job
(LD_LINK_PATH ?).
<li>Have OS's ship with programs which allow one to safely change
an executable's run-time linker path.
<li>Implement <tt>-s</tt> option
to <tt>ldd</tt> which prints this run-time path for a given executable.
(You can also see this with 'dump -Lv' in Solaris.)
<li>Solaris 7 has a neat idea.  There you can can specify a run time path
which is also evaluated at run time.  You link with an rpath of
<tt>$ORIGIN/../lib</tt>.  Here, $ORIGIN evaluates at run time to be
the installation path of the binary.  Now you can move the installation
tree to another location entirely and everything will still work.
We need this in other OS's!  Unfortunately, at least in Solaris 7,
$ORIGIN is considered a "relative" path (you can subvert it if
you have a writable directory on the same filesystem because
UNIX lets you hard link even a setuid executable) so it is
ignored on setuid/setgid binaries.  Sun has fixed this in Solaris
8.  You can specify with crle(1) paths that are "trustworthy".
