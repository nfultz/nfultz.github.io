Personally, I think this approach is a complexity and productivity disaster, but that deserves its own blog post --- [Youâ€™re Missing the Point of Server-Side Rendered JavaScript Apps : Tom Dale](http://tomdale.net/2015/02/youre-missing-the-point-of-server-side-rendered-javascript-apps/)

The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work.

Today, we announced the release of Scala.js v0.6.0, the Scala to JavaScript compiler, and dropped the experimental flag associated to it. Yes, you read it right: Scala.js is no longer experimental! After exactly 2 years of development, we finally feel comfortable calling it production-ready. --- [Scala.js no longer experimental | The Scala Programming Language](http://scala-lang.org/news/2015/02/05/scala-js-no-longer-experimental.html)
