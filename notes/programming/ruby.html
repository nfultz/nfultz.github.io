<article><p>The Future</p>
<p>Going forwards, I'd love to see some features from other languages make their way into Ruby. I agree with most everything Erik Michaels-Ober mentions in his talk: Towards a Higher-Level Language. Replace nil with Maybe in the language. Kill Symbol. Fix the standard numbers (this goes for almost every language using IEEE floats).</p>
<p>I also agree with the goals of Rubinius X. I want Immutable Data in Ruby. We NEED a real dependency system. If not as robust as Clojure's, let's atleast reach parity with Python. Even Javascript is beating Ruby now :(</p>
<p>I'd like to see optional typing of inputs/outputs.</p>
<p>And finally, pie in the sky, can we solve packaging apps up into distributable binaries, please? Rust and Go are making us look bad.</p>
